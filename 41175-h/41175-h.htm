<hr class="r20" />

<p class="p0">To those who live in the country, or repair to it from
our cities and towns for recreation or recruitment of
health, we trust this will be an acceptable book, especially
if they are unacquainted with Forest-trees. Our
aim has been to produce a volume that will convey
general and particular information respecting the timber-trees
chiefly cultivated in the United Kingdom, to
induce further inquiry respecting them, and to impart a
new interest to the Woodland. To effect this we have
briefly given their history and description, together with
their botanical characters, remarks from our best authors
on their habits and ornamental properties, on the usual
mode of their cultivation, and on the value or utility of
their timber. We have also introduced accounts of such
remarkable trees as we considered of sufficient note to
interest the general reader.</p>

<p>It has been objected that a few species, not recognised
as Forest-trees, have been included in this work; such
as the Hawthorn, Holly, Mountain-Ash, and Wild
Cherry. But as these have been likewise admitted into
a subsequent work of greater pretensions, the reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
there given by its author will be here equally sufficient:&mdash;"That
though aware of the secondary rank of these trees
in point of dimensions, when compared with the greater
denizens of the Forest, he felt that the prominent station
they occupy in the ornamental and picturesque departments
of our native Sylvia, was sufficient to compensate
for this defect, and to entitle them to the situation in
which they have been placed."</p>

<p>That the thirty-two species particularly described
may be the more readily identified, and their botanical
characters more easily understood, there has been given
a well executed wood-cut representation of the usual
growth and representation of each tree, and another of
the leaves, flowers, and fruit.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>

<hr class="r20" />

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">The forest teems</span><br />
With forms of majesty and beauty; some,<br />
As the light poplar, wave with every sigh<br />
Of zephyr, and some scarcely bend their heads<br />
For very mightiness, when wintry storms<br />
Are maddening the sea!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15.5em;"><span class="smcap">Carrington.</span></span><br />
</p>

<hr class="r20" />


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Delightful</span> Edlington! how we love to saunter up
and down the broad and verdant pathway that
traverses thy wild domain. There, amid the deep
imbosomed thickets, we feel that we are in "the
haunts of meditation"&mdash;we feel that these are,
indeed,</p>

<p class="poem">
The scenes where ancient bards th' inspiring breath<br />
Ecstatic felt;<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And wish that the kind muses that them inspired
would cast their united mantles over us, and aid
us to sing the beauties of the woodland. But no
friendly spirit deigns to tune our lyre; we are condemned
to dull prose, and are permitted only
here and there to call in some bard of old to aid
our feeble efforts. Woodland! yea, the very name
seems to revive recollections of delightful solitude&mdash;of
calm and holy feelings, when the world has
been, for the time, completely banished from its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">[010]</a></span>
throne&mdash;the throne of the human heart, which,
alas! it too commonly occupies. O, how agreeable
and pleasant is the woodland, when the trees are
half clad with their green attire! How refreshing
is the appearance of the tender leaf-bud, emerging
from its sheath, just visible upon the dingy gray
branches, those of one tree being generally a little
in advance of others! We have never yet met
with that insensate being whose heart is not elated
at the sight. And to look, at this time, upon the
vast assemblage of giant trees, whose skeleton,
character, and figure may now be plainly traced.
The dense foliage does not obscure them now, but
they are beheld in all their majesty. "If the
contrast of gray and mossy branches," says Howitt,
"and of the delicate richness of young leaves
gushing out of them in a thousand places be inexpressibly
delightful to behold, that of one tree
with another is not the less so. One is nearly
full clothed; another is mottled with gray and
green, struggling, as it were, which should have
the predominance, and another is still perfectly
naked. The pines look dim dusky amid the lively
hues of spring. The abeles are covered with their
clusters of alliescent and powdery leaves and
withering catkins; and beneath them the pale
spathes of the arum, fully expanded and displaying
their crimson clubs, presenting a sylvan and
unique air."</p>

<p>In Sweden, the budding and leafing of the
birch-tree is considered as a directory for sowing
barley; and as there is something extremely sublime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_011" id="Page_011">[011]</a></span>
and harmonious in the idea, we flatter ourselves
an account of it here will be acceptable.</p>

<p>Mr. Harold Barck, in his ingenious dissertation
upon the foliation of trees, informs us, that Linnæus
had, in the most earnest manner, exhorted
his countrymen to observe, with all care and
diligence, at what time each tree expanded its
buds and unfolded its leaves; imagining, and not
without reason, that his country would, some time
or other, reap some new and perhaps unexpected
benefit from observations of this kind made in
different places.</p>

<p>As one of the apparent advantages, he advises the
prudent husbandman to watch, with the greatest
care, the proper time for sowing; because this,
with the Divine assistance, produces plenty of
provision, and lays the foundation of the public
welfare of the state, and of the private happiness
of the people. The ignorant farmer, tenacious of
the ways and customs of his ancestors, fixes his
sowing season generally to a month, and sometimes
to a particular week, without considering whether
the earth be in a proper state to receive the seed;
from whence it frequently happens, that what the
sower sowed with sweat, the reaper reaps with
sorrow. The wise economist should therefore
endeavour to fix upon certain signs, whereby to
judge of the proper time for sowing. We see trees
open their buds and expand their leaves, from
whence we conclude that spring approaches, and
experience supports us in the conclusion; but
nobody has as yet been able to show us what trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">[012]</a></span>
Providence has intended should be our calendar,
so that we might know on what day the countryman
ought to sow his grain. No one can deny
but that the same power which brings forth the
leaves of trees, will also make the grain vegetate;
nor can any one assert that a premature sowing
will always, and in every place, accelerate a ripe
harvest. Perhaps, therefore, we cannot promise
ourselves a happy success by any means so likely,
as by taking our rule for sowing from the leafing
of trees. We must for that end observe in what
order every tree puts forth its leaves according to
its species, the heat of the atmosphere, and the
quality of the soil. Afterwards, by comparing
together the observations of the several years, it
will not be difficult to determine from the foliation
of the trees, if not certainly, at least probably, the
time when annual plants ought to be sown. It
will be necessary, likewise, to remark what sowings
made in different parts of the spring produce the
best crops, in order that, by comparing these with
the leafing of trees, it may appear which is the
most proper time for sowing.</p>

<p>The temperature of the season, with respect to
heat and cold, drought and wet, differing in every
year, experiments made one year cannot, with
certainty, determine for the following. They may
assist, but cannot be conclusive. The hints of
Linnæus, however, constitute a universal rule, as
trees and shrubs, bud, leaf, and flower, shed their
leaves in every country, according to the difference
of the seasons.</p>

<p>Mr. Stillingfleet is the only person that has
made correct observations upon the foliation of
the trees and shrubs of this kingdom. The following

<p>In different years, and in different soils and expositions,
these trees and shrubs vary as to their
leafing; but they are invariable as to their succession,
being bound down to it by nature herself.
A farmer, therefore, who would use this sublime
idea of Linnæus, should diligently mark the time
of budding, leafing, and flowering of different
plants. He should also put down the days on
which his respective grains were sown; and, by
comparing these two tables for a number of years,
he will be enabled to form an exact calendar for
his spring corn. An attention to the discolouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">[014]</a></span>
and falling of the leaves of plants, will assist him
in sowing his winter grain, and teach him how to
guess at the approach of winter. Towards the
end of September, which is the best season for
sowing wheat, he will find the leaves of various
trees as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Plane-tree, tawny.<br />
Oak, yellowish green.<br />
Hazel, yellow.<br />
Sycamore, dirty brown.<br />
Maple, pale yellow.<br />
Ash, fine lemon.<br />
Elm, orange.<br />
Hawthorn, tawny yellow.<br />
Cherry, red.<br />
Hornbeam, bright yellow.<br />
</p>

<p>There is a certain kind of genial warmth which
the earth should enjoy at the time the seed is
sown. The budding, leafing, and flowering of
plants, seem to indicate this happy temperature
of the earth. Appearances of this sublime nature
may be compared to the writing upon the wall,
which was seen by many, but understood by few.
They seem to constitute a kind of harmonious
intercourse between God and man, and are the
silent language of the Deity.</p>

<p class="poem">
Welcome, ye shades! ye bowery thickets, hail!<br />
Ye lofty pines! ye venerable oaks!<br />
Ye ashes wild, resounding o'er the steep!<br />
Delicious is your shelter to the soul!<br />
</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, the woodland is an ever-pleasant
place. There we may couch ourselves upon the
mossy bank, and listen to the murmuring "brook
that bubbles by," or to the sweet sounds that
issue from</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Every warbling throat</span><br />
Heard in the tuneful woodlands.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">[015]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">Yea, truly,</p>

<p class="poem">
There, plunged amid the shadows brown,<br />
Imagination lays him down,<br />
Attentive, in his airy mood,<br />
To every murmur of the wood;<br />
The bee in yonder flowery nook,<br />
The chidings of the headlong brook,<br />
The green leaf shivering in the gale,<br />
The warbling hills, the lowing vale,<br />
The distant woodman's echoing stroke,<br />
The thunder of the falling oak.<br />
</p>

<p>Carlos Wilcox sings so sweetly of vernal melody
in the forest, that we shall favour our readers with
his song:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">With sonorous notes</span><br />
Of every tone, mixed in confusion sweet,<br />
All chanted in the fulness of delight,<br />
The forest rings. Where, far around enclosed<br />
With bushy sides, and covered high above<br />
With foliage thick, supported by bare trunks,<br />
Like pillars rising to support a roof,<br />
It seems a temple vast, the space within<br />
Rings loud and clear with thrilling melody.<br />
Apart, but near the choir, with voice distinct,<br />
The merry mocking-bird together links<br />
In one continued song their different notes,<br />
Adding new life and sweetness to them all:<br />
Hid under shrubs, the squirrel, that in fields<br />
Frequents the stony wall, and briery fence,<br />
Here chirps so shrill that human feet approach<br />
Unheard till just upon him, when, with cries,<br />
Sudden and sharp, he darts to his retreat,<br />
Beneath the mossy hillock or aged tree;<br />
But oft, a moment after, re-appears,<br />
First peeping out, then starting forth at once<br />
With a courageous air, yet in his pranks<br />
Keeping a watchful eye, nor venturing far<br />
Till left unheeded.<br />
</p>

<p>As the summer advances, forest-trees assume a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">[016]</a></span>
beautiful variety. The Oak has "spread its amber
leaves out in the sunny sheen;" the ash, the
maple, the beech, and the sycamore are each clad
in delicate vestures of green; and the dark
perennial firs are enlivened and enriched by the
young shoots and the cones of lighter hue.</p>

<p>"In the middle of summer," observes Howitt,
"it is the very carnival of Nature, and she is
prodigal of her luxuries." It is luxury to walk
abroad, indulging every sense with sweetness,
loveliness, and harmony. It is luxury to stand
beneath the forest side, when all is still and
basking, at noon; and to see the landscape suddenly
darken, the black and tumultuous clouds
assemble as at a signal; to hear the awful thunder
crash upon the listening ear; and then, to mark
the glorious bow rise on the lurid rear of the
tempest, the sun laugh jocundly abroad, and every
bathed leaf and blossom fair,</p>

<p class="center">
Pour out its soul to the delicious air.<br />
</p>

<p>But of the seasons autumn is the most pleasant
for a woodland ramble. The depth of gloom, the
silence, the wild cries that are heard flitting to
and fro; the falling leaves already rustling to the
tread, and strewing the forest walk, render it
particularly pleasant. "And then those breaks;
those openings; those sudden emergings from
shadow and silence to light and liberty; those
unexpected comings out to the skirts of the forest,
or to some wild and heathy tract in the very depth
of the woodlands! How pleasant is the thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">[017]</a></span>
of it!" The appearance of woods in autumn is
indeed more picturesque, and more replete with
incidental beauty than at any season of the year.
So evident is this, that painters have universally
chosen it as the season of landscape. The leafy
surface of the forest is then so varied, and the
masses of foliage are yet so full, that they allow
the artist great latitude in producing his tints,
without injuring the breadth of his lights.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&mdash;The fading, many-coloured woods,</span><br />
Shade deepening over-shade, the country round<br />
Imbrown; a varied umbrage, dusk and dun,<br />
Of every hue, from wan declining green<br />
To sooty dark.<br />
</p>

<p>Of all the hues of autumn, those of the oak are
commonly the most harmonious. In an oaken
wood, you see every variety of green and brown,
owing either to the different exposure of the tree,
the difference of the soil, or its own nature. In
the beechen grove, this variety is not to be found.
In early autumn, when the extremities of the trees
are slightly tinged with orange, it may be partially
produced; but late the eye is usually fatigued with
one deep monotonous shade of orange, though
perhaps it is the most beautiful among all the
hues of autumn. And this uniformity prevails
wherever the ash and elm abound, though of a
different hue; and, indeed, no fading foliage excepting
that of the oak, produces harmony of
colouring.</p>

<p>Even when the beauty of the landscape has
departed, the charms of autumn may remain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">[018]</a></span>
When the raging heat of summer is abated, and
ere the rigours of winter are set in, there are
frequent days of such heavenly temperature, that
every mind must feel their effect. Thomson thus
describes a day of this kind:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">The morning shines</span><br />
Serene, in all its dewy beauties bright,<br />
Unfolding fair the last autumnal day,<br />
O'er all the soul its sacred influence breathes;<br />
Inflames imagination, through the breast<br />
Infuses every tenderness, and far<br />
Beyond dim earth exalts the swelling thought.<br />
</p>

<p>We now proceed to give a detailed notice of some
of the component parts of the woodland scenery,
beginning with the single tree.</p>

<p>We feel no hesitation in calling a tree the grandest
and most beautiful of all the various productions
of the earth. In respect to its grandeur, nothing
can compete with it; for the everlasting rocks and
lofty mountains are parts of the earth itself. And
though we find great beauty&mdash;beauty at once perceptible
and ever-varying, and consequently more
universally felt and appreciated&mdash;among plants of
an inferior order&mdash;among shrubs and flowers, yet
these latter may be considered beautiful rather as
individuals, for as they are not adapted to form
the arrangement of composition in landscape, nor
to receive the effect of light and shade, they must
give place in point of beauty&mdash;of picturesque
beauty at least&mdash;to the form, and foliage, and
ramification of the tree.</p>

<p>The tree, however, we do not place in competition
with animal life. "The shape, the different coloured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">[019]</a></span>
furs, the varied and spirited attitudes, the character
and motion, which strike us in the animal
creation, are unquestionably beyond still life in
its most pleasing appearance." With regard to
trees, nature has been more liberal to them in
point of variety, than even to its living forms.
"Though every animal is distinguished from its
fellow, by some little variation of colour, character,
or shape; yet in all the larger parts, in the body
and limbs, the resemblance is generally exact. In
trees, it is just the reverse: the smaller parts, the
spray, the leaves, the blossom, and the seed, are
the same in all trees of the same kind; while the
larger parts, from which the most beautiful varieties
result, are wholly different." For instance, you
never see two oaks with the same number of limbs,
the same kind of head, and twisted in the same
form.</p>

<p>When young, trees, like striplings, shoot into
taper forms. There is a lightness and an airiness
about them, which is pleasing; but they do not
spread and receive their just proportions, until
they have attained their full growth.</p>

<p>There is as much difference, too, in trees&mdash;that
is, in trees of the same kind&mdash;in point of beauty,
as there is in human figures. The limbs of some
are set on awkwardly, their trunks are disproportioned,
and their whole form is unpleasing. The
same rules, which establish elegance in other
objects, establish it in these. There must be the
same harmony of parts, the same sweeping line,
the same contrast, the same ease and freedom. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">[020]</a></span>
bough, indeed, may issue from the trunk at right
angles, and yet elegantly, as it frequently does in
the oak; but it must immediately form some contrasting
sweep, or the junction will be awkward.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, trees when lapped and
trimmed into fastidious shapes, become ugly and
displeasing. Thus clipped yews, lime hedges, and
pollards, being rendered unnatural in form, are
disagreeable; though sometimes a pollard produces
a good effect, when Nature has been suffered, after
some years, to bring it again into shape.</p>

<p>Lightness is a characteristic of beauty in a tree;
for though there are beautiful trees of a heavy, as
well as of a light form, yet their extremities must
in some parts be separated, and hang with a degree
of looseness from the fulness of the foliage, which
occupies the middle of the tree, or the whole will
only be a large bush. From position, indeed, and
contrast, heaviness, though in itself a deformity,
may be of singular use in the composition both of
natural and of artificial landscape.</p>

<p>A tree must be well balanced to be beautiful,
for it may have form and lightness, and yet lose
its effect from not being properly poised; though
occasionally beauty may be found in an unbalanced
tree, yet this must be caused by some peculiarity
in its situation. For instance, when hanging over
a rock, if altogether unpoised, it may be beautiful;
or bending over a road, its effect may be good.</p>

<p>We have often admired the massy trunk of an
aged forest oak; and Gilpin says he frequently
examined the varied tints which enriched its furrowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021">[021]</a></span>
stem. The genuine bark of an oak is ash-coloured,
though it is not easy to distinguish this,
from the quantity of moss which overspreads it;
for we suppose every oak has more or less of these
picturesque appendages. About the roots there is
a green velvet moss, which is found in a greater
degree to occupy the hole of the beech, though its
beauty and brilliancy lose much when in decay.
As the trunk rises, you see the brimstone colour
taking possession in patches. Of this there are
two principal kinds: a smooth sort, which spreads
like a scurf over the bark, and a rougher sort,
which hangs in little rich knots and fringes. This
sometimes inclines to an olive hue, and occasionally
to a light-green. Intermixed with these mosses is
frequently found a species perfectly white. Here
and there, a touch of it gives lustre to the trunk,
and has its effect; yet, on the whole, it is a nuisance,
for as it generally begins to thrive when the
other mosses begin to wither, it is rarely accompanied
with any of the more beautiful species of
its kind. This is a sure sign that the vigour of
the tree is declining. There is another species of
a dark brown colour, inclining to black; another
of an ashy colour; and another of a dingy yellow.
Touches of red are also observable, and occasionally,
though rarely, a bright yellow, which is like
a gleam of sunshine. These add a great richness
to the trees, and when blended harmoniously, as
they commonly are, the rough and furrowed trunk
of an oak, thus adorned, is an object which will
long detain the picturesque eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022">[022]</a></span></p>

<p>These and other incidental appendages to a tree
are greatly subservient to the uses of the pencil,
and the poet will now and then deign to deck his
trees with these ornaments. He sometimes calls
into being some mighty agent, as guardian of the
woods, who cries out,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">From Jove I am the Power</span><br />
Of this fair wood, and live in oaken bower.<br />
I nurse my saplings tall; and cleanse their rind<br />
From vegetating filth of every kind;<br />
And all my plants I save from nightly ill<br />
Of noisome winds, and blasting vapours chill.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">The blasted tree adds much to effect, both in artificial
and natural landscape. In some scenes it is
nearly essential. When the dreary heath is spread
before the eye, and ideas of wildness and desolation
are required, what more suitable accompaniment
can be imagined, than the blasted oak, ragged,
scathed, and leafless, shooting its peeled white
branches athwart the gathering blackness of some
rising storm?</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">As when heaven's fire</span><br />
Hath scathed the forest oak, or mountain pine,<br />
With singed top its stately growth, though bare,<br />
Stands on the blasted heath.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">&mdash;beneath that oak,</span><br />
Whose shattered majesty hath felt the stroke<br />
Of Heaven's own thunder&mdash;yet it proudly heaves<br />
A giant sceptre wreathed with blasted leaves&mdash;<br />
As though it dared the elements.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Neale.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Ivy also gives great richness to an old trunk,
both by its stem, which often winds round it in
thick, hairy, irregular volumes; and by its leaf,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">[023]</a></span>
which either decks the furrowed bark, or creeps
among the branches, or carelessly hangs from
them. It unites with the mosses, and other furniture
of the trees, in adorning and enriching it.</p>

<p>The tribes of mosses, lichens, and liver-worts,
are all parasitical; it is doubted whether the ivy
is or not. The former, however, are absolute retainers.
The character of the ivy, too, has been
misrepresented, if his feelers have not some other
purpose than that of enabling him to show his
attachment to his patient supporter. Shakspeare
asserts that he makes a property of him:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11.5em;">He was</span><br />
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,<br />
And sucked my verdure out.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Besides these there are others which are sustained
entirely by their own means. Among them we
may distinguish the black and white briony. The
berries of many of these little plants are variously
coloured in the different stages of their growth&mdash;yellow,
red, and orange. All these produce their
effect. The feathered seeds of the traveller's joy
are also ornamental. The wild honeysuckle comes
within this class; and it fully compensates for any
injury it may do by the compression of the young
branches, by its winding spiral coils, and by the
beauty and fragrance of its flowers:</p>

<p class="poem">
With clasping tendrils it invests the branch,<br />
Else unadorned, with many a gay festoon,<br />
And fragrant chaplet; recompensing well<br />
The strength it borrows with the grace it lends.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">In warm climates, where vines are the spontaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">[024]</a></span>
offspring of nature, nothing can have a more pleasing
effect than the forest-tree adorned with their
twisting branches, hanging in rich festoons from
bough to bough, and laden with fruit,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">the clusters clear</span><br />
Half through the foliage seen.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">In England, the hop we consider the most beautiful
appendage of the hanging kind. In its rude
natural state, indeed, twisting carelessly round the
branches of trees, it has as good an effect as the
vine. Its leaf is similar; and though its bunches
are not so beautiful as the clusters of the vine, it
is more accommodating, hangs more loosely, and
is less extravagant in its growth.</p>

<p>The motion of trees is one source of considerable
beauty. The waving heads of some, and the undulation
of others, give a continual variety to their
forms. In nature this is certainly a circumstance
of great beauty:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Things in motion sooner catch the eye</span><br />
Than what stirs not;<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">and this also affords the chequered shade, formed
under it by the dancing of the sunbeams among
its playing leaves. This circumstance is of a very
amusing nature, and is capable of being beautifully
wrought up in poetry:</p>

<p class="poem">
The chequered earth seems restless as a flood<br />
Brushed by the winds. So sportive is the light,<br />
Shot through the boughs, it dances as they dance,<br />
Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick,<br />
And darkening and enlightening (as the leaves<br />
Play wanton) every part.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">[025]</a></span></p>

<p>The clump of trees next occupies our attention.
The term, says Gilpin, has rather a relative meaning,
as no rule of art hath yet prescribed what
number of trees form a clump. Near the eye we
should call three or four trees a clump, and at the
same time, in distant or extensive scenery, we
should apply the same term to any smaller detached
portion of wood, though it may be formed of hundreds
of trees. But though the term admits not
of exact definition, we will endeavour to make the
ideas contained under it as distinct as possible.</p>

<p>We distinguish, then, two kinds of clumps, the
smaller and the larger; confining the former chiefly
to the foreground, and considering the latter as a
distant ornament.</p>

<p>With respect to the former, we apprehend its
chief beauty arises from contrast in the parts. We
shall attempt to enumerate some of the sources
whence the beauty of contrast is produced. Three
trees, or more, standing in a line, are formal, but
in the natural wood this formality is rarely found.
And yet even three trees in a line will be greatly
assisted by the lines of the several trunks taking
different directions; and by the various forms,
distances, and growth of the trees.</p>

<p>If three trees do not stand in a line, they must
of course stand in a triangle, which produces a
great variety of pleasing forms. And if a fourth
tree be added, it stands beautifully near the middle
of the triangle, of whatever form the triangle may
be. If the clump consist of more trees than four,
a still greater variety among the stems will of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">[026]</a></span>
course take place; double triangles, and other
pleasing shapes, all of which may be seen exemplified
in every wood of natural growth.</p>

<p>The branches are not less the source of contrast
than the stem. To be picturesque, they must intermingle
with each other without heaviness; they
must hang loosely, but yet with varied looseness
on every side; and if there be one head or top of
the tree above another, there may be two or three
subordinate, according to the size of the clump.</p>

<p>Different kinds of trees, in the same clump, often
occasion a beautiful contrast. There are few trees
which will not harmonize with trees of another
kind; though it may be that contrasts the most
simple and beautiful are produced by the various
modes of growth in the same species. Two or
three oaks, intermingling their branches together,
have often a very pleasing effect. The beech,
when fully grown, is commonly (in a luxuriant soil
at least), so heavy, that it seldom blends happily,
either with its own kind or any other. The silver
fir, too, is a very unaccommodating tree, as also
all the other firs, and indeed every kind of tree
that tapers to a point. The pine race, however,
being clump-headed, unite well in composition.
With these also the Scotch fir leagues, from little
knots of which we often see beautiful contrasts
arise. When they are young and luxuriant, especially
if any number of them above four or five
are planted together, they generally form a heavy
murky spot, but as they acquire age this heaviness
goes off, the inner branches decay, the outer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">[027]</a></span>
branches hang loosely and negligently, and the
whole has frequently a good effect, unless they
have been planted too closely. It may be doubted
how far deciduous trees mingle well in a clump
with evergreens; and yet, occasionally, from the
darkness of the fir contrasting agreeably with the
sprightly green of a deciduous tree just coming
into leaf, a natural good effect of light and shade
is produced.</p>

<p>Contrasts arise, again, from the mixture of trees
of unequal growth, from a young tree united with
an old one, a stunted tree with a luxuriant one,
and sometimes from two or three trees, which in
themselves are ill-shaped, but when combined are
pleasing. Inequalities of all these kinds are what
chiefly give nature's planting a superiority over art.</p>

<p>The form of the foliage is another source of contrast.
In one part, where the branches intermingle,
the foliage will be interwoven and close; in another,
where the boughs of each tree hang separately, the
appearance will be light and easy.</p>

<p>But whatever beauty these contrasts exhibit, the
effect is altogether lost if the clump be not well
balanced. If no side preponderate so as to offend
the eye, it is enough, and unless the clump have
sustained some external injury, it is seldom deficient
in point of balance. Nature generally conducts
the stems and branches in such easy forms,
wherever there is an opening, and fills up all with
such nice contrivance, and with so much picturesque
irregularity, that we rarely wish for an
amendment in her works. So true is this, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">[028]</a></span>
you may not take away a tree from a clump without
infallibly destroying the balance which can
never again be restored.</p>

<p>When the clump grows larger, it becomes qualified
only as a remote object, combining with vast
woods, and forming a part of some extensive scene,
either as a first, a second, or a third distance.</p>

<p>The great use of the larger clump is to lighten
the heaviness of a continued distant wood, and
connect it gently with the plain, that the transition
may not be too abrupt. All we wish to find in a
clump of this kind is proportion and general form.</p>

<p>With respect to proportion, the detached clump
must not encroach too much on the dignity of the
wood it aids, but must observe a proper subordination.
A large tract of country covered with wood,
will admit several of these auxiliary clumps, of
different dimensions. But if the wood be of a
smaller size, the clumps must also be smaller and
fewer.</p>

<p>As the clump becomes larger and recedes in the
landscape, all the pleasing contrasts we expected
in the smaller clumps are lost, and we are satisfied
with a general form. No regular form is pleasing.
A clump on the side of a hill, or in any situation
where the eye can more easily investigate its
shape, must be circumscribed by an irregular line;
in which the undulations, both at the base and
summit of the clump, should be strongly marked,
as the eye has probably a distinct view of both.
But if seen only on the top of a hill, or along the
distant horizon, a little variation in the line which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">[029]</a></span>
forms the summit, so as to break any disagreeable
regularity there, will be sufficient.</p>

<p>As a large tract of wood requires a few large
clumps to connect it gently with the plain, so these
large clumps themselves require the same service
from a single tree, or a few trees, according to their
size.</p>

<p>The Copse, the Glen, and the open Grove next
demand our notice.</p>

<p>The Copse is a species of scenery composed generally
of forest-trees, intermixed with brushwood,
which latter is periodically cut down in twelve,
thirteen, or fourteen years. In its dismantled
state, nothing can be more forlorn. The area is
covered with bare roots and knobs, from which the
brushwood has been cut; while the forest-trees,
intermingled among them, present their ragged
stems, despoiled of all their lateral branches, which
the luxuriance of the surrounding thickets had
choked. The copse, however, soon repairs the injury
it has thus suffered. One winter only sees
its disgrace. The following summer produces
luxuriant shoots; and two summers more restore
it almost to perfect beauty.</p>

<p>It is of little moment what species of wood composes
the copse; for we do not expect from it scenes
of picturesque beauty, but are satisfied if it yields
us a shady sequestered path, which it generally
furnishes in great perfection. It is among the
luxuries of nature, to retreat into the cool recesses
of the full-grown copse from the severity of a meridian
sun, and to be serenaded by the humming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">[030]</a></span>
insects of the shade, whose continuous song has a
more refreshing sound than the buzzing vagrant
fly, which wantons in the glare of day, and, as
Milton expresses it,</p>

<p class="center">
&mdash;&mdash;winds her sultry horn.<br />
</p>

<p>In distant landscape the copse hath seldom any
effect. The beauty of a wood in a distant view
arises in some degree from its tuftings which break
and enrich the lights, but chiefly from its contrast
with the plain, and from the grand shapes and
forms, occasioned by the retiring and advancing
parts of the forest, which produce vast masses of
light and shade, and give effect to the whole.</p>

<p>These beauties appear rarely in the copse. Instead
of that rich and tufted bed of foliage, which
the distant forest exhibits, the copse presents a
meagre and unaccommodating surface. It is age
which gives the tree its tufted form, and the forest
its effect. A nursery of saplings produces it not, and
the copse is little more, nor does the intermixture
of full-grown trees assist the appearance. Their
clumpy heads blend ill with the spiry tops of the
juniors. Neither have they any connection with
each other. The woodman's judgment is shown
in leaving the timber-trees at proper intervals,
that they may neither hinder each other's growth,
nor the growth of the underwood. But the woodman
does not pretend to manage his trees with a
view to picturesque beauty; and from his management,
it is impossible they should produce a mass
of light and shade. Besides, the copse forms no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_031" id="Page_031">[031]</a></span>
contrast with the plain, nor presents those beautiful
projections and recesses which the skirts of the
forest exhibit. A copse is a plot of ground, proportioned
off for the purpose of nurturing wood.
Of course it must be fenced from cattle; and these
fences, which are in themselves disgusting, generally
form the copse into a square, or some other
regular figure; so that we have not only a deformity,
but a want also of a connecting tie between
the wood and the plain. Instead of a softened
undulating line, we have a harsh fence.</p>

<p>The best effect which the copse produces, is on
the lofty banks of the river; this may be seen particularly
on the Wye. In navigating such a river,
the deficiencies of this mode of scenery, as you view
it upwards from a boat, are lost; and in almost
every state it has a good effect. While it enriches
the bank, its uncouth shape, unless the fence is too
much in view, and all its other unpleasant appearances,
are concealed.</p>

<p>When a winding walk is carried through a copse,
which must necessarily in a few years, even in
point of picturesque beauty, be given to the axe,
shall the whole be cut down together? Or shall
a border be left, as is sometimes done, on each side
of the walk?</p>

<p>This is a difficult question; but Gilpin thinks it
should all go together. Unless the border you
leave be very broad, it will have no effect, even at
present. You will see through it; it will appear
meagre, and will never unite happily with the
neighbouring parts when they begin to grow; at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">[032]</a></span>
least, it ought not to stand longer than two years.
The rest of the copse will then be growing beautiful,
and the border may be dispensed with till it is
replaced. But the way, decidedly, is to cut down
all together. In a little time it will recover its
beauty.</p>

<p>We now proceed to the Glen. A wide and open
space between hills, is called a vale. If it be of
smaller dimensions, we call it a valley. But when
this space is contracted to a chasm, it becomes a
glen.</p>

<p>A glen, therefore, is commonly the offspring of
a mountainous country; though sometimes found
elsewhere, with its usual accompaniments of woody
banks, and a rivulet at the bottom. The glen may
be more or less contracted. It may form one single
sweep, or its deviations may be irregular. The
wood may consist of full-grown trees, or of underwood,
or of a mixture of both. The path winding
through it may run along the upper or the lower
part. Or the rivulet may foam among rocks, or
murmur among pebbles;&mdash;it may form transparent
pools, overhung with wood;&mdash;or, which is frequently
the case, it may be invisible, and an object only of
the ear. All these circumstances are capable of
an infinite variety.</p>

<p>The beauties of the internal parts of the glen
consist chiefly in the glades, or openings, which
are found in it. If the whole were a thicket, little
beauty would result. Unlike the copse, its furniture
is commonly of a fortuitous growth, and
escapes those periodical defalcations to which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033">[033]</a></span>
copse is subject, and generally exhibits more beautiful
scenery. It abounds with frequent openings.
The eye is carried down, from the higher grounds,
to a sweep of the river&mdash;or to a little gushing cascade&mdash;or
to the face of a fractured rock, garnished
with hanging wood&mdash;or perhaps to a cottage, with
its scanty area of lawn falling to the river on one
side, and sheltered by a clump of oaks on the
other; while the smoke, wreathing behind the
trees, disperses and loses itself as it gains the
summit of the glen. Or, still more beautifully,
the eye breaks out at some opening, perhaps into
the country, enriched with all the varieties of distant
landscape&mdash;plains and woods melting together&mdash;a
winding river&mdash;blue mountains&mdash;or perhaps
some bay of the sea, with a little harbour and
shipping.</p>

<p>As an object of distance also, the woody glen
has often a good effect&mdash;climbing the sides of
mountains, breaking their lines, and giving variety
to their bleak and barren sides.</p>

<p>From the glen we hasten to the open Grove,
which is composed of trees arising from a smooth
area, and consisting either of pines or of the deciduous
race. Beautiful groves of both may be seen.
That of the pine will always be dry, as it is the
peculiar quality of its leaves to imbibe moisture:
but in lightness, variety, and general beauty, that
of deciduous trees excels. If, however, you wish
your grove to be in the gloomy style, the pine race
will serve your purpose best.</p>

<p>The open grove rarely makes a picturesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_034" id="Page_034">[034]</a></span>
appearance. It may, indeed, have the effect of
other woods in distant scenery; for the trees of
which it is formed need not be separated from each
other, as in the copse, but, being well massed together,
may receive beautiful effects of light. When
we enter its recesses, it is not so well calculated to
please. There it wants variety, and that not only
from the smoothness of the surface, but from the
uniformity of the furniture&mdash;at least if it be an
artificial scene, in which the trees, having been
planted in a nursery, grow all alike, with upright
stems. And yet a walk, upon a velvet turf, winding
at pleasure among these natural columns,
whose twisting branches at least admit some
variety, with a spreading canopy of foliage over
the head, is pleasing, and in hot weather refreshing.
Sometimes we find the open grove of natural
growth; it is then more various and irregular, and
becomes, of course, a more pleasing scene. And
yet, when woods of this kind continue, as they
sometimes do, in unpeopled countries, through
half a province, they become tiresome, and prove
that it is not wood, but variety of landscape, that
delights the eye. The pleasing tranquillity of
groves hath ever been in high repute among the
innocent and refined part of mankind:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Groves were planted to console at noon</span><br />
The pensive wanderer in their shades. At eve<br />
The moonbeam sliding softly in between<br />
The sleeping leaves, is all the light he wants<br />
For meditation.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Indeed, no species of landscape is so fitted for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">[035]</a></span>
meditation. The forest attracts the attention by
its grandeur, and the park scene by its beauty;
while the paths through copses, dells, and thickets,
are too close, devious, interrupted, and often too
beautiful to allow the mind to be at perfect ease.
But the uniform sameness of the grove leaves the
eye disengaged; and the feet wandering at pleasure,
where they are confined by no path, want
little direction. The mind, therefore, undisturbed,
has only to retire within itself. Hence the philosopher,
the devotee, the poet, all retreated to these
quiet recesses; and,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">from the world retired,</span><br />
Conversed with angels and immortal forms.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">In classic times, the grove was the haunt of gods;
and in the days of Nature, before art had introduced
a kind of combination against her, men had
no idea of worshipping God in a temple made with
hands. The <i>templum nemorale</i> was the only temple
he knew.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">In the resounding wood,</span><br />
All vocal beings hymned their equal God.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And to this idea, indeed, one of the earliest forms
of the artificial temple seems to have been indebted.
Many learned men have thought the
Gothic arch of our cathedral churches was an
imitation of the natural grove. It arises from a
lofty stem, or from two or three stems, if they be
slender; which being bound together, and spreading
in every direction, cover the whole roof with
their ramifications. In the close recesses of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">[036]</a></span>
beechen grove, we find this idea the most complete.
The lofty, narrow aisle&mdash;the pointed arch&mdash;the
clustered pillar, whose parts separating without
violence, diverge gradually to form the fretted
roof&mdash;find there perhaps their earliest archetype.
Bryant has wrought out this idea in a beautiful
fragment, entitled "God's First Temples:"</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned</span><br />
To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave,<br />
And spread the roof above them,&mdash;ere he framed<br />
The lofty vault, to gather and roll back<br />
The sound of anthems,&mdash;in the darkling wood,<br />
Amidst the cool and silence he knelt down,<br />
And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks<br />
And supplication. For his simple heart<br />
Might not resist the sacred influences,<br />
That, from the stilly twilight of the place,<br />
And from the gray old trunks, that, high in heaven,<br />
Mingled their mossy boughs, and from the sound<br />
Of the invisible breath that swayed at once<br />
All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed<br />
His spirit with the thought of boundless Power<br />
And inaccessible Majesty. Ah, why<br />
Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect<br />
God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore<br />
Only among the crowd, and under roofs<br />
That our frail hands have raised! Let me, at least,<br />
Here in the shadow of this aged wood,<br />
Offer one hymn&mdash;thrice happy, if it find<br />
Acceptance in his ear.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Father, thy hand</span><br />
Hath reared these venerable columns; thou<br />
Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down<br />
Upon the naked earth, and, forthwith, rose<br />
All these fair ranks of trees. They, in thy sun,<br />
Budded, and shook their green leaves in thy breeze,<br />
And shot towards heaven. The century-living crow,<br />
Whose birth was in their tops, grew old and died<br />
Among their branches, till at last they stood,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">[037]</a></span>
As now they stand, massy, and tall, and dark,<br />
Fit shrine for humble worshipper to hold<br />
Communion with his Maker. Here are seen<br />
No traces of man's pomp or pride;&mdash;no silks<br />
Rustle, no jewels shine, nor envious eyes<br />
Encounter; no fantastic carvings show<br />
The boast of our vain race to change the form<br />
Of thy fair works. But thou art here&mdash;thou fill'st<br />
The solitude. Thou art in the soft winds<br />
That run along the summits of these trees<br />
In music;&mdash;thou art in the cooler breath,<br />
That, from the inmost darkness of the place,<br />
Comes, scarcely felt;&mdash;the barky trunks, the ground,<br />
The fresh, moist ground, are all instinct with thee.<br />
Here is continual worship;&mdash;nature, here,<br />
In the tranquillity that thou dost love,<br />
Enjoys thy presence. Noiselessly, around,<br />
From perch to perch, the solitary bird<br />
Passes; and yon clear spring, that, 'midst its herbs,<br />
Wells softly forth, and visits the strong roots<br />
Of half the mighty forest, tells no tale<br />
Of all the good it does. Thou hast not left<br />
Thyself without a witness, in these shades,<br />
Of thy perfections. Grandeur, strength, and grace,<br />
Are here to speak of thee. This mighty oak&mdash;<br />
By whose immovable stem I stand, and seem<br />
Almost annihilated&mdash;not a prince,<br />
In all the proud old world beyond the deep,<br />
E'er wore his crown as loftily as he<br />
Wears the green coronal of leaves with which<br />
Thy hand has graced him. Nestled at his root<br />
Is beauty, such as blooms not in the glare<br />
Of the broad sun. That delicate forest flower,<br />
With scented breath, and look so like a smile,<br />
Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mould,<br />
An emanation of the indwelling Life,<br />
A visible token of the upholding Love,<br />
That are the soul of this wide universe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart is awed within me, when I think</span><br />
Of the great miracle that still goes on,<br />
In silence, round me&mdash;the perpetual work<br />
Of thy creation, finished, yet renewed<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">[038]</a></span>
For ever. Written on thy works, I read<br />
The lesson of thy own eternity.<br />
Lo! all grow old and die: but see, again,<br />
How, on the faltering footsteps of decay,<br />
Youth presses&mdash;ever gay and beautiful youth,<br />
In all its beautiful forms. These lofty trees<br />
Wave not less proudly than their ancestors<br />
Moulder beneath them. O, there is not lost<br />
One of earth's charms: upon her bosom yet,<br />
After the flight of untold centuries,<br />
The freshness of her far beginning lies,<br />
And yet shall lie. Life mocks the idle hate<br />
Of his arch-enemy Death&mdash;yea, seats himself<br />
Upon the sepulchre, and blooms and smiles,<br />
And of the triumphs of his ghastly foe<br />
Makes his own nourishment. For he came forth<br />
From thine own bosom, and shall have no end.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There have been holy men, who hid themselves</span><br />
Deep in the woody wilderness, and gave<br />
Their lives to thought and prayer, till they outlived<br />
The generation born with them, nor seemed<br />
Less aged than the hoary trees and rocks<br />
Around them;&mdash;and there have been holy men,<br />
Who deemed it were not well to pass life thus.<br />
But let me often to these solitudes<br />
Retire, and, in thy presence, reassure<br />
My feeble virtue. Here its enemies,<br />
The passions, at thy plainer footsteps shrink,<br />
And tremble, and are still. O God! when thou<br />
Dost scare the world with tempests, set on fire<br />
The heavens with falling thunderbolts, or fill,<br />
With all the waters of the firmament,<br />
The swift, dark whirlwind, that uproots the woods,<br />
And drowns the villages; when, at thy call,<br />
Uprises the great Deep, and throws himself<br />
Upon the continent, and overwhelms<br />
Its cities;&mdash;who forgets not, at the sight<br />
Of these tremendous tokens of thy power,<br />
His pride, and lays his strifes and follies by?<br />
O, from these sterner aspects of thy face,<br />
Spare me and mine; nor let us need the wrath<br />
Of the mad, unchained elements to teach<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039">[039]</a></span>
Who rules them. Be it ours to meditate,<br />
In these calm shades, thy milder majesty,<br />
And, to the beautiful order of thy works,<br />
Learn to conform the order of our lives.<br />
</p>

<p>We will conclude this Introduction by recommending
the reader, in the words of the poet, to
enjoy the sweet calmness of the Woodland retreat:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If thou art worn and hard beset</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With sorrows that thou would'st forget&mdash;</span><br />
If thou would'st read a lesson that will keep<br />
Thy heart from fainting, and thy soul from sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Go to the woods and hills!&mdash;no tears</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dim the sweet look that nature wears.</span><br />

<span class="smcap">Stranger</span>, if thou hast learnt a truth, which needs<br />
Experience more than reason, that the world<br />
Is full of guilt and misery, and hast known<br />
Enough of all its sorrows, crimes and cares,<br />
To tire thee of it,&mdash;enter this wild wood,<br />
And view the haunts of Nature. The calm shade<br />
Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze,<br />
That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm<br />
To thy sick heart. Thou wilt find nothing here<br />
Of all that pained thee in the haunts of men.<br />
And made thee loathe thy life. The primal curse<br />
Fell, it is true, upon the unsinning earth,<br />
But not in vengeance. Misery is wed<br />
To guilt. And hence these shades are still the abodes<br />
Of undissembled gladness: the thick roof<br />
Of green and stirring branches is alive<br />
And musical with birds, that sing and sport<br />
In wantonness of spirit; while, below,<br />
The squirrel, with raised paws and form erect,<br />
Chirps merrily. Throngs of insects in the glade<br />
Try their thin wings, and dance in the warm beam<br />
That waked them into life. Even the green trees<br />
Partake the deep contentment: as they bend<br />
To the soft winds, the sun from the blue sky<br />
Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene.<br />
Scarce less the cleft-born wild-flower seems to enjoy<br />
Existence, than the winged plunderer<br />
That sucks its sweets. The massy rocks themselves,<br />
The old and ponderous trunks of prostrate trees,<br />
That lead from knoll to knoll, a causey rude,<br />
Or bridge the sunken brook, and their dark roots,<br />
With all their earth upon them; twisting high<br />
Breathe fixed tranquillity. The rivulet<br />
Sends forth glad sounds, and, tripping o'er its bed<br />
Of pebbly sands, or leaping down the rocks,<br />
Seems with continuous laughter to rejoice<br />
In its own being. Softly tread the marge,<br />
Lest from her midway perch thou scare the wren<br />
That dips her bill in water. The cool wind,<br />
That stirs the stream in play shall come to thee,<br />
Like one that loves thee, nor will let thee pass<br />
Ungreeted, and shall give its light embrace.<br />

<h2>THE ALDER-TREE.</h2>

</div>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Alder (<i>A. glutinosa</i>), is the most
aquatic of European trees. It grows to the height
of fifty or sixty feet, in favourable situations by
the sides of streams, and is a somewhat picturesque
tree in its ramification as well as its foliage. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">[042]</a></span>
is nearly related, in nature rather than in form,
to the willow tribe; it is more picturesque than
the latter, and perhaps the most so of any of the
aquatic species, except the weeping willow. Gilpin
says, that if we would see the Alder in perfection,
we must follow the banks of the Mole, in Surrey,
through the sweet vales of Dorking and Mickleham,
into the groves of Esher. The Mole, indeed, is far
from being a beautiful river; it is a silent and sluggish
stream: but what beauty it has it owes greatly
to the Alder, which everywhere fringes its meadows,
and in many places forms very pleasing scenes;
especially in the vale between Box Hill and the
high grounds of Norbury Park. Spenser probably
once reposed under the shade of these trees, as he
mentions them in his "Colin Clout's come home
again."</p>

<p class="poem">
One day, quoth he, I sate, as was my trade,<br />
Under the foot of Mole, that mountain hore,<br />
Keeping my sheep among the cooly shade<br />
Of the green Alders on the Mulla shore.<br />
</p>

<p>Some of the largest Alders in England grow in
the Bishop of Durham's park, at Bishop Auckland.
In speaking of these, Gilpin remarks, that "the
generality of trees acquire picturesque beauty by
age; but it is not often that they are suffered to
attain this picturesque period. Some use is commonly
found for them long before that time. The
oak falls for the greater purposes of man, and the
Alder is ready to supply a variety of his smaller
wants. An old tree, therefore, of any kind is a
curiosity; and even an Alder, such as those at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_043" id="Page_043">[043]</a></span>
Bishop Auckland, when dignified by age, makes a
respectable figure."</p>

<p class="figcaption"><i>Specific character of A. glutinosa. Common Alder.</i> Leaves
roundish, cuneate, waved, serrate, glutinous, downy at the branching
of the veins beneath. A moderately-sized tree, with rugged
bark, and crooked, spreading, smooth branches: barren catkins
long, pendulous; fertile ones short, oval. Flowers in March.</p>
</div>

<p>The Alder grows naturally in Europe from Lapland
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">[044]</a></span>
to Gibraltar, in Asia from the White Sea to
Mount Caucasus, and in the north of Africa, as
well as being indigenous in England. The flowers
bloom in March and April; they have no gay tints
or beauty to recommend them, and consequently
afford pleasure only to the botanist or the curious
observer of nature. The leaves begin to open
about the 7th of April, and when fully expanded
are of a deep dull green. The bark being smooth
and of a purplish hue, the tree has an agreeable
effect among others in all kinds of plantations of
the watery tribe.</p>

<p>The Alder must have grown to a great size in
days of yore; for Virgil speaks of vessels made of
this material:</p>

<p class="center">
When hollow Alders first the waters tried.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And again:</p>

<p class="center">
And down the rapid Po light Alders glide.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Ovid also tells us that</p>

<p class="poem">
Trees rudely hollowed did the waves sustain,<br />
Ere ships in triumph ploughed the watery main.<br />
</p>

<p>Abroad this tree is raised from seed, which is
decidedly the best mode, and secures the finest
specimens; though in this country they are generally
propagated by layers or truncheons. The
best time for planting the latter, is in February or
March; the truncheons being sharpened at the
end, the ground should be loosened by thrusting an
iron crow into it, to prevent the bark from being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">[045]</a></span>
torn off; and they should be planted at the least
two feet deep. When cultivated by layers, the
planting should take place in October, and they will
then be ready to transplant in twelve months' time.</p>

<p>The Alder is usually planted as coppice-wood, to
be cut down every five or six years, for conversion
into charcoal, which is preferred in making gunpowder.
The bark on the young wood is powerfully
astringent, and is employed by tanners; and the
young shoots are used for dyeing red, brown, and
yellow; and in combination with copperas, to dye
black. It is greatly cultivated in Flanders and
Holland for piles, for which purpose it is invaluable,
as when constantly under water, or in moist
and boggy situations, it becomes hardened, black
as ebony, and will last for ages. On this account
it is also very serviceable in strengthening the
embankments of rivers or canals; and while the
roots and trunks are preventing the encroachment
of the stream, they throw out branches which may
be cut for poles every fifth or sixth year, especially
if pruned of superfluous shoots in the spring.</p>

<p class="poem">
As Alders in the spring, their boles extend,<br />
And heave so fiercely that the bark they rend.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;" class="smcap">Virgil</span>, <i>ecl.</i> x.<br />
</p>

<p>Vitruvius informs us, that the morasses about
Ravenna were piled with this timber to build upon;
and Evelyn says that it was used in the foundations
of Ponte Rialto, over the Grand Canal at Venice.
The wood is also valuable for various domestic
purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">[046]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the common Alder there are introduced
at least six other species:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>A. Glutinosa</i>, already described.</p>

<p>2. <i>Emarginata</i>, leaves nearly round, wedge-shaped,
and edged with green.</p>

<p>3. <i>Laciniata</i>, leaves oblong and pinnatifid, with
the lobes acute.</p>

<p>4. <i>Quercifolia</i>, leaves sinuated, with the lobes
obtuse.</p>

<p>5. <i>Oxyacanth&oelig;folia</i>, leaves sinuated and lobed;
smaller than those of the preceding variety, and
somewhat resembling the common hawthorn.</p>

<p>6. <i>Macrocarpa</i>, leaves and fruit larger than those
of the species.</p>

<p>7. <i>Foliis variegatis</i>, leaves variegated.</p>

<h2>THE ASH-TREE.</h2>

<p class="blockquot">
[<i>Fraxinus.</i><a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> Nat. Ord.&mdash;<i>Oleaceæ</i>; Linn.&mdash;<i>Dian. Monog.</i>]

<div class="footnote">

2-seeded capsule, flattened and foliaceous at the extremity (a
<i>samara</i>). Name from <a name="phraxis"></a>&#966;&#961;&#945;&#958;&#953;&#962;, separation, on account of the ease
with which the wood may be split.</p>
</div>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Ash (<i>F. excelsior</i>), is one of the noblest
of our forest-trees, and generally carries its principal
stem higher than the oak, rising in an easy
flowing line. Its chief beauty, however, consists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">[048]</a></span>
in the lightness of its whole appearance. Its
branches at first keep close to the trunk, and form
acute angles with it; but as they begin to lengthen,
they commonly take an easy sweep; and the looseness
of the leaves corresponding with the lightness
of the spray, the whole forms an elegant depending
foliage. Nothing can have a better effect than an
old Ash hanging from the corner of a wood, and
bringing off the heaviness of the other foliage with
its loose pendent branches. And yet in some soils,
the Ash loses much of its beauty in the decline of
age. The foliage becomes rare and meagre; and
its branches, instead of hanging loosely, start away
in disagreeable forms; thus the Ash often loses that
grandeur and beauty in old age, which the generality
of trees, and particularly the oak, preserve
till a late period of their existence.</p>

<p>The Ash also falls under the displeasure of the
picturesque eye on another account, that is, from
its leaf being much tenderer than that of the oak,
it sooner receives impressions from the winds and
frosts. Instead, therefore, of contributing its tint
in the wane of the year among the many-coloured
offspring of the woods, it shrinks from the blast,
drops its leaf, and in each scene where it predominates,
leaves wide blanks of desolated boughs,
amidst foliage yet fresh and verdant. Before its
decay, we sometimes see its leaf tinged with a fine
yellow, well contrasted with the neighbouring
greens. But this is one of Nature's casual beauties.
Much oftener its leaf decays in a dark,
muddy, unpleasing tint. And yet, sometimes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">[049]</a></span>
notwithstanding this early loss of its foliage, we
see the Ash, in a sheltered situation, when the
rains have been abundant and the season mild,
retain its light pleasant green, when the oak and
the elm, in its neighbourhood, have put on their
autumnal attire. The leaves of the common Ash
were used as fodder for cattle by the Romans, who
esteemed them better for that purpose than those
of any other tree: and in this country, in various
districts, they were used in the same manner.</p>

<p>The common Ash is indigenous to northern and
central Europe, to the north of Africa, and to
Japan. The Romans, it is said, named it <i>Fraxinus,
quia facile frangitur</i>, to express the fragile
nature of the wood, as the boughs of it are easily
broken. It is supposed that the name of Ash has
been given to this tree, because the bark of the
trunk and branches is of the colour of wood ashes.
Some, however, affirm that the word is derived
from the Saxon <i>Æsc</i>, a pike.</p>

<p>It is recorded in the fables of the ancients, that
Love first made his arrows of this wood. The disciples
of Mars used ashen poles for lances:</p>

<p class="poem">
A lance of tough ground Ash the Trojan threw,<br />
Rough in the rind and knotted as it grew.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Æneid.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Virgil says that the spears of the Amazons were
formed of this wood, and Homer sings the mighty
ashen spear of Achilles:</p>

<p class="poem">
The noble Ash rewards the planter's toil;<br />
Noble, since great Achilles from her side<br />
Took the dire spear by which brave Hector died.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Rapin.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050">[050]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">It is said, in the Edda, that the Ash was held in
high veneration, and that man was formed from its
wood. Hesiod, in like manner, deduces his brazen
race of men from the Ash.</p>

<p class="center">
The warlike Ash, that reeks with human blood.<br />
</p>

<p>There are many remarkable Ash-trees in various
parts of the country. One at Woburn Abbey measures
at the ground twenty-three feet in circumference;
at twelve inches from the ground, it is twenty
feet; and fifteen feet three inches at three feet from
the ground. It is ninety feet high, and the ground
overshadowed by its branches is one hundred and
thirteen feet in diameter. The trunk of another,
near Kennety Church, in King's County, is twenty-one
feet ten inches in circumference, and seventeen
feet high, before the branches break out, which are
of enormous bulk. There formerly stood in the
church-yard of Kilmalie, in Lochaber, an Ash that
was considered the largest and most remarkable
tree in the Highlands. Lochiel and his numerous
kindred and clan held it in great veneration for
generations, which is supposed to have hastened
its destruction; it being burnt to the ground by
the brutal soldiery in 1746. In one direction its
diameter was seventeen feet three inches, and the
cross diameter twenty-one feet; its circumference
at the ground was fifty-eight feet!</p>

<p class="figcaption"><i>Specific characters of F. excelsior. Common Ash.</i> Leaves
pinnate, with lanceolate, serrated leaflets: flowers destitute of
calyx and corolla. In old trees, the lower branches, after bending
downwards, curve upwards at their extremities. Flowers,
in loose panicles: anthers large, purple: capsules with a flat leaf-like
termination, generally of two cells, each containing a flat
oblong seed. This beautiful tree assumes its foliage later than
any of our trees, and loses it early. A <i>variety</i> occurs with simple
leaves, and another with pendulous branches. Flowers in April
and May; grows in natural woods in many parts of Scotland.</p>
</div>

<p>Trees raised from the keys of the Ash are decidedly
the best. The "keys," or tongues, should be
gathered from a young thriving tree when they
begin to fall (which is about the end of October),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">[052]</a></span>
laid to dry, and then sown any time betwixt that
and Christmas. They will remain a full year in
the ground before they appear; it is therefore
necessary to fence them in, and wait patiently.
The Ash will grow exceedingly well upon almost
any soil, and indeed is frequently met with in
ruined walls and rocks, insinuating its roots into
the crevices of decaying buildings, covering the
surface with verdure, while it is instrumental in
destroying that which yields it support. Its
winged capsules are supposed to be deposited in
those places by the wind.</p>

<p class="poem">
The Ash asks not a depth of fruitful mould,<br />
But, like frugality, on little means<br />
It thrives, and high o'er creviced ruins spreads<br />
Its ample shade, or in the naked rock,<br />
That nods in air, with graceful limbs depends.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Bidlake.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Southey, in <i>Don Roderick</i>, speaks of the Ash:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;amid the brook,</span><br />
Gray as the stone to which it clung, half root,<br />
Half trunk, the young Ash rises from the rock,<br />
And there its parent lifts its lofty head,<br />
And spreads its graceful boughs; the passing wind<br />
With twinkling motion lifts the silent leaves,<br />
And shakes its rattling tufts.<br />
</p>

<p>The roots of the Ash are remarkably beautiful,
and often finely veined, and will take a good polish.
There are also certain knotty excrescences in the
Ash, called the <i>brusca</i>, and <i>mollusca</i>, which, when
cut and polished, are very beautiful. Dr. Plot, in
his <i>History of Oxfordshire</i> mentions a dining-table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">[053]</a></span>
made of them, which represented the exact figure
of a fish.</p>

<p>With the exception of that of the oak, the timber
of the Ash serves for the greatest variety of uses of
any tree in the forest. It is excellent for ploughs.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Tough, bending Ash,</span><br />
Gives to the humble swain his useful plough,<br />
And for the peer his prouder chariot builds.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Dodsley.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">It is also used for axle-trees, wheel-rings, harrows;
and also makes good oars, blocks for pulleys, &amp;c.
It is of the utmost value to the husbandman for
carts, ladders, &amp;c., and the branches are very serviceable
for fuel, either fresh or dry. The most
profitable age for felling the Ash, appears to be
from eighty to one hundred years. It will continue
pushing from stools or from pollards, for
above one hundred years.</p>

<p>Though a handsome tree, it ought by no means
to be planted for ornament in places designed to
be kept neat, because the leaves fall off, with their
long stalks, very early in the autumn, and by their
litter destroy the beauty of such places; yet, however
unfit for planting near gravel-walks, or pleasure-grounds,
it is very suitable for woods, to form
clumps in large parks, or to be set out as standards.
It should never be planted on tillage land, as the
dripping of the leaves injures the corn, and the
roots tend to draw away all nourishment from the
ground. Neither should it be planted near pasture
ground; for if the kine eat the leaves or shoots,
the butter will become rank, and of little value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_054" id="Page_054">[054]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many varieties of the common Ash,
but that with pendulous branches is probably the
best known: it is called the Weeping Ash, and is
of a heavy and somewhat unnatural appearance,
yet it is very generally admired.</p>

<p>The foliage of the Ash-tree becomes of a brown
colour in October.</p>

<p class="poem">
Like leaves on trees the race of man is found&mdash;<br />
Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;<br />
Another race the following spring supplies,<br />
They fall successive, and successive rise:<br />
So generations in their course decay,<br />
So flourish these, when those are past away.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;" class="smcap">Pope.</span><br />
</p>

<p>There are numerous species of the Ash, but
these are so rarely to be met with in this country,
that it is not necessary to particularize any of
them.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Beech (<i>F. sylvática</i>), is supposed to
be indigenous to England, but not to Scotland or
Ireland. According to Evelyn, it is a beautiful
as well as valuable tree, growing generally to
a greater stature than the Ash: though Gilpin
observes, that it does not deserve to be ranked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">[056]</a></span>
among timber-trees; its wood being of a soft,
spongy nature, sappy, and alluring to the worm.
Neither will Gilpin allow that, in point of picturesque
beauty, it should rank much higher than
in point of utility. Its skeleton, compared with
that of the oak, the ash, or the elm, he says, is
very deficient; yet its trunk is often highly picturesque,
being frequently studded with bold knobs
and projections, and having sometimes a sort of
irregular fluting about it, which is very characteristic.
It has another peculiarity, also, which is
somewhat pleasing&mdash;that of a number of stems
arising from the root. The bark, too, wears often
a pleasant hue. It is naturally of a dingy olive;
but it is always overspread, in patches, with a
variety of mosses and lichens, which are commonly
of a lighter tint in the upper parts, and of a deep
velvet green towards the root. Its smoothness,
also, contrasts agreeably with these rougher appendages.
No bark tempts the lover so much to
make it the depository of his mistress's name. In
days of yore, it seems to have commonly served as
the lover's tablet. In Dryden's translation of
Virgil's <i>Eclogues</i>, we find the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Or shall I rather the sad verse repeat,<br />
Which on the Beech's bark I lately writ&mdash;<br />
I writ, and sang betwixt.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">There seems to have been connected with this custom
the curious idea, that as the tree increased in
growth, so would the words, and also the hopes
expressed thereon:</p>

<p class="poem">
The rind of every plant her name shall know,<br />
And as the rind extends the love shall grow.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057">[057]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">Our own Thomson, too, narrates that Musidora
carved, on the soft bark of a Beech-tree, the confession
of her attachment to Damon:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">At length, a tender calm,</span><br />
Hushed, by degrees, the tumult of her soul;<br />
And on the spreading Beech, that o'er the stream<br />
Incumbent hung, she, with the sylvan pen<br />
Of rural lovers, this confession carved,<br />
Which soon her Damon kissed with weeping joy.<br />
</p>

<p>The branches of the Beech are fantastically
wreathed and disproportioned, twining awkwardly
among one another, and running often into long
unvaried lines, without any of that strength and
firmness which we admire in the oak, or of that
easy simplicity which pleases in the ash: in short,
we rarely see a Beech well ramified. In full leaf,
it is unequally pleasing; it has the appearance of
an overgrown bush. Virgil, indeed, was right in
choosing the Beech for its shade. No tree forms
so complete a roof. If you wish either for shade
or shelter, you will find it best</p>

<p class="center">
Beneath the shade which Beechen boughs diffuse.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Its bushiness imparts a great heaviness to the tree,
which is always a deformity:</p>

<p class="center">
A gloomy grove of Beech.<br />
</p>

<p>Sometimes a light branch issues from a heavy mass;
and though these are often beautiful in themselves,
they are seldom in harmony with the tree. They
distinguish, however, its character, which will be
best seen by comparing it with the elm. The latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_058" id="Page_058">[058]</a></span>
has a rounder, the former a more pointed foliage;
but the elm is always in harmony with itself.
Gilpin can see few beauties in the Beech; but, in
conclusion, he admits that it sometimes has its
beauty, and often its use. In distance, it preserves
the depth of the forest, and, even on the spot, in
contrast, it is frequently a choice accompaniment.
In the corner of a landscape, too, when a thick
heavy tree is wanted, or a part of one, at least,
which is often necessary, nothing answers the purpose
like the Beech.</p>

<p>If we would really appreciate the beauty of this
tree, we should walk in a wood of them. In its
juvenility, contrary to the generality of trees, the
Beech is decidedly the most pleasing, not having
acquired that heaviness which Gilpin so loudly
complains of. A light, airy young Beech, with its
spiry branches hanging in easy forms, is generally
beautiful. And, occasionally, the forest Beech, in
a dry hungry soil, preserves the lightness of youth
in the maturity of age.</p>

<p>We must, however, mention its autumnal hues,
which are often beautiful. Sometimes it is dressed
in modest brown, but commonly in glowing orange;
and in both dresses its harmony with the grove is
pleasing. About the end of September, when the
leaf begins to change, it makes a happy contrast
with the oak, whose foliage is yet verdant. Some
of the finest oppositions of tint which, perhaps,
the forest can furnish, arise from the union of oak
and Beech. We often see a wonderful effect from
this combination; and yet, accommodating as its

leaf is in landscape, on handling, it feels as if it
were fabricated with metallic rigour.</p>

<p class="figcaption"><i>Specific character. F. sylvática. Common Beech.</i> Leaves
ovate, indistinctly serrate, smooth, ciliate. A large tree, varying
from 60 to 100 feet in height, with smooth bark and spreading
branches. Flowers in April and May; grows in woods, particularly
on calcareous soils.</p>

<p>The leaves are of a pleasant green, and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">[060]</a></span>
of them remain on the branches during winter.
In France and Switzerland, when dried, they are
very commonly used for beds, or, instead of straw,
for mattresses. Its fruit consists of "two nuts
joined at the base, and covered with an almost
globular involucre, which has soft spines on the
outside, but within is delicately smooth and silky."
Beech mast, as it is called, was formerly used for
fattening swine and deer. It affords also a sweet
oil, which the poor in France are said to eat most
willingly.</p>

</p>

<p>The Beech abounds especially along the great
ridge of chalk-hills which passes from Dorsetshire
through Wiltshire, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex,
and Kent; trenching out into Berkshire, Buckinghamshire,
and Hertfordshire; and it is also found
on the Stroudwater and Cotswold hills in Gloucestershire,
and on the banks of the Wye in Herefordshire
and Monmouthshire. It is particularly
abundant in Buckinghamshire, where it forms
extensive forests of great magnificence and beauty.
It is seldom found mixed with other trees, even
when they are coeval with it in point of age. It
is rarely found in soil that is not more or less calcareous;
and it most commonly abounds on chalk.
The finest trees in England are said to grow in
Hampshire; and there is a curious legend respecting
those in the forest of St. Leonard, in that
county. This forest, which was the abode of St.
Leonard, abounds in noble Beech-trees; and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">[061]</a></span>
saint was particularly fond of reposing under their
shade; but, when he did so, he was annoyed during
the day by vipers, and at night by the singing of
the nightingale. Accordingly, he prayed that they
might be removed; and such was the efficacy of
his prayers, that since his time, in this forest,</p>

<p class="poem">
"The viper has ne'er been known to sting,<br />
Or the nightingale e'er heard to sing."<br />
</p>

<p>The wood of this tree, from its softness, is easy
of being worked, and is consequently a favourite
with the turner. Beechen bowls, curiously carved,
were highly prized by the ancient shepherds. Indeed,
we learn that their use was almost universal:</p>

<p class="poem">
Hence, in the world's best years, the humble shed<br />
Was happily and fully furnished:<br />
Beech made their chests, their beds, and the joined stools;<br />
Beech made the board, the platters, and the bowls.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And it is still used for dishes, trays, trenchers, &amp;c.
And Dodsley informs us that it was used for the
sounding-boards of musical instruments.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">&mdash;The soft Beech</span><br />
And close-grained box employ the turner's wheel;<br />
And with a thousand implements supply<br />
Mechanic skill.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">We cannot willingly conclude this article without
introducing Wordsworth's beautiful description of
a solitary Beech-tree, which stood within "a stately
fir-grove," where he was not loth</p>

<p class="poem">
To sympathize with vulgar coppice birds,<br />
That, for protection from the nipping blast,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_062" id="Page_062">[062]</a></span>
Thither repaired. A single Beech-tree grew<br />
Within this grove of firs, and in the fork<br />
Of that one Beech appeared a thrush's nest:<br />
A last year's nest, conspicuously built<br />
At such small elevation from the ground,<br />
As gave sure sign that they who in that house<br />
Of nature and of love had made their home,<br />
Amid the fir-trees all the summer long,<br />
Dwelt in a tranquil spot.<br />
</p>

<p>The principal varieties of the Beech are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Purpurea</i>, the purple Beech, which has the
buds and young shoots of a rose colour; the leaves,
when half developed, of a cherry red, and of so
dark a purple, when fully matured, as to appear
almost black.</p>

<p>2. <i>Foliis variegatis</i>, having the leaves variegated
with white and yellow, interspersed with some
streaks of red and purple.</p>

<p>3. <i>Pendulata</i>, the weeping Beech, having the
branches beautifully pendent.</p>

</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> common Birch (<i>B. alba</i>) is a native of the
colder regions of Europe and Asia, being found
from Iceland to Mount Etna; in Siberia, as far as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">[064]</a></span>
the Altaic mountains; and also in the Himalayas;
but not in Africa. It is known, at first sight, by
the silvery whiteness of its bark, the comparative
smallness of its leaves, and the lightness and airiness
of its whole appearance. It is admirably calculated
to diversify the scene, forming a pleasing
variety among other trees, either in summer or
winter. In summer it is covered over with beautiful
small leaves, and the stem being generally
marked with brown, yellow, and silvery touches
of a peculiarly picturesque character, as they are
characteristic objects of imitation for the pencil,
forms an agreeable contrast with the dark green
hue of the foliage, as it is waved to and fro by
every breath of air. Only the stem and larger
branches, however, have this varied colouring:
the spray is of a deep brown, which is the colour,
too, of the larger branches, where the external
rind is peeled off. As the tree grows old, its bark
becomes rough and furrowed; it loses all its varied
tints, and assumes a uniform ferruginous hue.</p>

<p>The Birch is altogether raised from roots or
suckers, which, being planted at intervals of four
or five feet, in small twigs, will speedily rise to
trees, provided the soil suit them, and this cannot
well be too barren or spongy; for it will thrive
in dry and wet, sandy or stony places, in marshes
or bogs.</p>

<p>In ancient times, the Birch, whose timber is
almost worthless, according to Evelyn, afforded
the Old English warriors arrows, bolts, and shafts;
and in modern times, its charcoal forms a principal
ingredient in the manufacture of gunpowder. In
spring, the Birch abounds in juices, and from
these the rustic housewife makes an agreeable and
wholesome wine: as Warton sings:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_065" id="Page_065">[065]</a></span></p>

unequally serrate, nearly smooth. A moderately-sized tree,
seldom exceeding fifty feet in height, with a trunk of from twelve
to eighteen inches in diameter, with a white outer bark, peeling
transversely, the twigs very slender, and more or less drooping.
Flowers in April and May; grows abundantly in extensive natural
woods in various parts of the country, particularly in the Highlands
of Scotland.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">[066]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
And though she boasts no charm divine,<br />
Yet she can carve, and make Birch wine.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Pomona's bard says, also, that</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">&mdash;Even afflictive Birch,</span><br />
Cursed by unlettered idle youth, distils<br />
A limpid current from her wounded bark,<br />
Profuse of nursing sap.<br />
</p>

<p>We are informed that a Birch-tree has been
known to yield, in the course of the season, a
quantity of sap equal to its own weight. It is
obtained by inserting, in the early part of spring,
a fosset made of an elder stick, with the pith taken
out; and setting vessels, or hanging bladders, to
receive the liquor. The sooner it is boiled the
better; so that, in order to procure a sufficient
quantity in a short time, a number of trees should
be bored on the same day, and two or three fossets
inserted in each of the larger trees. Sugar is now
commonly used to sweeten it, in the proportion of
from two to four pounds to each gallon of liquor.
This is allowed to simmer so long as any scum
rises, which must be cleared as fast as it appears.
It is then poured into a tub to cool, after which it
is turned into a cask, and bunged up when it has
done working; and is ready to be drunk when a
year old.</p>

<p>As before remarked, the timber of the Birch is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067">[067]</a></span>
of little value; though in the Highlands, where
pine is not to be had, it is used for all purposes.
Its stems form the rafters of cabins; "wattles of
the boughs are the walls and the door; and even
the chests and boxes are of this rude basket-work."</p>

<p>Light and strong canoes were formerly made of
this timber in Britain, and also in other parts of
Europe; and are even now in the northern parts
of America. It also makes good fuel; and in
Lancashire great quantities of besoms are made
for exportation from the slender twigs. The bark
is used in Russia and Poland for the covering of
houses, instead of slates or tiles; and anciently
the inner white cuticle and silken bark were used
for writing-paper. Coleridge describes</p>

<p class="poem">
A curious picture, with a master's haste<br />
Sketched on a strip of pinky-silver skin<br />
Peeled from the Birchen bark.<br />
</p>

<p>There is no part of this tree, however, that is
not useful for some purpose or other. Even its
leaves are used by the Finland women, in forming
a soft elastic couch for the cradle of infancy.</p>

<p>Gilpin particularly notes a beautiful variety of
the White Birch, <i>B. pendula</i>, sometimes called the
Lady Birch, or the Weeping Birch. Its spray being
slenderer and longer than the common sort, forms
an elegant pensile foliage, like the weeping willow,
and, like it, is put in motion by the smallest breeze.
When agitated, it is well adapted to characterize
a storm, or to perform any office in landscape
which is expected from the weeping willow. This
is agreeably described in Wilson's Isle of Palms:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">[068]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">&mdash;on the green slope</span><br />
Of a romantic glade we sate us down,<br />
Amid the fragrance of the yellow broom,<br />
While o'er our heads the Weeping Birch-tree streamed<br />
Its branches, arching like a fountain shower.<br />
</p>

<p>"A Weeping Birch, at Balloghie, in the parish
of Birse, in Aberdeenshire, in 1792, measured five
feet in circumference; but it carried nearly this
degree of thickness, with a clear stem, up to the
height of about fifty feet, and it was judged to be
about one hundred feet high."</p>

<h2>THE CEDAR OF LEBANON.</h2>

And casts his sweets around him.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;" class="smcap">Barry Cornwall.</span><br />
</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Cedar of Lebanon is a majestic evergreen
tree, generally from fifty to eighty feet in height,
extending wide its boughs and branches; and its
sturdy arms grow in time so weighty, as frequently
to bend the very stem and main shaft. Phillips
observes, that "this noble tree has a dignity and
a general striking character of growth so peculiar
to itself, that no other tree can possibly be mistaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">[070]</a></span>
for it. It is instantly recognized by its wide-extending
branches, that incline their extremities
downwards, exhibiting a most beautiful upper surface,
like so many verdant banks, which, when
agitated by the wind, play in the most graceful
manner, forming one of the most elegant, as well
as one of the most noble, objects of the vegetable
kingdom."</p>

<p>The Cedar of Lebanon was formerly supposed
to grow nowhere but on that mountain; but it was
discovered, in 1832, on several mountains of the
same group, and the probability is, that it extends
over the whole of the Tauri mountains. It has
also been discovered on the Atlas range of northern
Africa.</p>

<p>It is generally spoken of as a lofty tree. Milton,
in speaking of it, says,</p>

<p class="poem">
Insuperable height of loftiest shade.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And Rowe, in his Lucan, alludes to the "tall
Cedar's head;" and Spenser speaks of the "Cedar
tall;" and Churchill sings,</p>

<p class="poem">
The Cedar, whose top mates the highest cloud.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Notwithstanding these poetical authorities for the
loftiness of the Cedar, we are assured by Evelyn,
and others, that it is not lofty, but is rather remarkable
for its wide-spreading branches. In
Prior's Solomon, we read of</p>

<p class="poem">
The spreading Cedar that an age had stood,<br />
Supreme of trees, and mistress of the wood,<br />
Cut down and carved, my shining roof adorns,<br />
And Lebanon his ruined honour mourns.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">[071]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">Mason describes it as far-spreading:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;Cedars here,</span><br />
Coeval with the sky-crowned mountain's self,<br />
Spread wide their giant arms.<br />
</p>

<p>The prophet Ezekiel has given us the fullest
description of the Cedar: "Behold the Assyrian
was a Cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches, and
with a shadowing shroud, and of a high stature;
and his top was among the thick boughs. His
boughs were multiplied, and his branches became
long. The fir-trees were not like his boughs, nor
the chestnut-trees like his branches, nor any tree
in the garden of God like unto him in beauty."</p>

<p>In this description, two of the principal characteristics
of the Cedar are marked.</p>

<p>The first is, the multiplicity and length of his
branches. Few trees divide so many fair branches
from the main stem, or spread over so large a compass
of ground. His boughs are multiplied, as
Ezekiel says, and his branches become long, which
David calls spreading abroad.</p>

<p>The second characteristic is his shadowing shroud.
No tree in the forest is more remarkable than the
Cedar for its close-woven leafy canopy. Ezekiel's
Cedar is marked as a tree of full and perfect
growth, from the circumstance of its top being
among the thick boughs. Almost every young
tree, and particularly every young Cedar, has
what is called a leading branch or two, which continue
spiring above the rest till the tree has attained
its full size; then the tree becomes, in the language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">[072]</a></span>
of the nurseryman, clump-headed: but, in the language
of eastern sublimity its top is among the
thick boughs; that is, no distinction of any spiry
head, or leading branch, appears; the head and
the branches are all mixed together. This is
generally, in all trees, the state in which they are
most perfect and most beautiful. Such is the
grandeur and form of the Cedar of Lebanon. Its
mantling foliage, or shadowing shroud, as Ezekiel
calls it, is its greatest beauty, which arises from
the horizontal growth of its branches forming a
kind of sweeping, irregular penthouse. And when
to the idea of beauty that of strength is added, by
the pyramidal form of the stem, and the robustness
of the limbs, the tree is complete in all its beauty
and majesty. In these climates, indeed, we cannot
expect to see the Cedar in such perfection. The
forest of Lebanon is, perhaps, the only part of the
world where its growth is perfect; yet we may, in
some degree, conceive its beauty and majesty,
from the paltry resemblances of it at this distance
from its native soil. In its youth, it is often with
us a vigorous thriving plant; and if the leading
branch is not bound to a pole (as many people
deform their Cedars), but left to take its natural
course, and guide the stem after it in some irregular
waving line, it is often an object of great
beauty. But, in its maturer age, the beauty of
the English Cedar is generally gone; it becomes
shrivelled, deformed, and stunted; its body increases,
but its limbs shrink and wither. Thus it
never gives us its two leading qualities together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">[073]</a></span>
In its youth, we have some idea of its beauty, without
its strength; and in its advanced age, we have
some idea of its strength, without its beauty. The
imagination, therefore, by joining together the two
different periods of its age in this climate, may
form some conception of the grandeur of the Cedar
in its own climate, where its strength and beauty
are united.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">[074]</a></span></p>

<p>The following particular botanical description
of this celebrated tree, is given by Loudon in his
<i>Arboretum</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The <i>leaves</i> are generally of a dark grass green, straight, about
one inch long, slender, nearly cylindrical, tapering to a point, and
are on foot-stalks. The leaves, which remain two years on the
branches, are at first produced in tufts; the buds from which
they spring having the appearance of abortive shoots, which,
instead of becoming branches, only produce a tuft of leaves
pressed closely together in a whorl. These buds continue, for
several years in succession, to produce every spring a new tuft
of leaves, placed above those of the preceding year; and thus
each bud may be said to make a slight growth annually, but so
slowly, that it can scarcely be perceived to have advanced a line
in length; hence, many of these buds may be found on old trees,
which have eight or ten rings, each ring being the growth of one
year; and sometimes they ramify a little. At length, sooner or
later, they produce the male and female flowers. The <i>male catkins</i>
are simple, solitary, of a reddish hue, about two inches long,
terminal, and turning upwards. They are composed of a great
number of sessile, imbricated stamens, on a common axis. Each
stamen is furnished with an anther with two cells, which open
lengthwise by their lower part; and each terminates in a sort of
crest, pointing upwards. The pollen is yellowish, and is produced
in great abundance. The <i>female catkins</i> are short, erect,
roundish, and rather oval; they change, after fecundation, into
ovate oblong <i>cones</i>, which become, at maturity, from two and a
half to five inches long. The cones are of a grayish-brown, with
a plum-coloured or pinkish bloom when young, which they lose
as they approach maturity; they are composed of a series of
coriaceous imbricated <i>scales</i>, laid flat, and firmly pressed against
each other in an oblique spiral direction. The scales are very
broad, obtuse, and truncated at the summit; very thin, and
slightly denticulated at the edge; and reddish and shining on the
flat part. Each scale contains two seeds, each surmounted by a
very thin membranous <i>wing</i>, of which the upper part is very
broad, and the lower narrow, enveloping the greater part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_075" id="Page_075">[075]</a></span>
seed. The cones are very firmly attached to the branches; they
neither open nor fall off, as in the other Abietinæ; but, when
ripe, the scales become loose, and drop gradually, leaving the
axis of the cone still fixed on the branch. The <i>seeds</i> are of an
irregular, but somewhat triangular form, nearly one and a half
inch long, of a lightish brown colour. Every part of the cone
abounds with resin, which sometimes exudes from between the
scales. The female catkins are produced in October, but the
cones do not appear till the end of the second year; and, if not
gathered, they will remain attached to the tree for several years.
The Cedar of Lebanon does not begin to produce cones till it is
twenty-five or thirty years old; and, even then, the seeds in such
cones are generally imperfect; and it is not till after several years
of bearing, that seeds from the cones of young trees can be depended
upon. Some Cedars produce only male catkins, and
these in immense abundance; others, only female catkins; and
some both. There are trees of vigorous growth at various places,
which, though upwards of one hundred years old, have scarcely
ever produced either male or female catkins. The duration of
the Cedar is supposed to extend to several centuries."</p>
</div>

<p>The Cedar is cultivated from seeds and berries.
Any climate suits it, provided it meet with a
sandy soil; though it grows better in cold than in
warm climates, as its cultivation is more successful
in Scotland than in England.</p>

<p>The peculiar property of its timber is extremely
remarkable, being declared proof against all putrefaction
of human or other bodies, serving better
than all other ingredients or compositions for embalming;
thus, by a singular contradiction, giving
life as it were to the dead, and destroying the worms
which are living, as it does, where any goods are
kept in chests and presses of the wood&mdash;except
woollen cloths and furs, which, it is observed, they
destroy. Its preservative power is attributed to
the bitterness of its resinous juices. The ancients,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_076" id="Page_076">[076]</a></span>
in praising any literary work, would say, "It is
worthy of being cased in Cedar." It is also very
durable, it being on record that in the Temple of
Apollo, at Utica, there was found timber of near
two thousand years old.</p>

<p>The most remarkable existing Cedars in this
country are at Chelsea, at Enfield, at Chiswick
House, at Sion House, at Strathfieldsaye, at Charley
Wood near Rickmansworth, at Wilton, near
Salisbury and at Osgood Hanbury's near Coggeshall.
The largest of these, at Strathfieldsaye, is
one hundred and eight feet in height; diameter of
the trunk, three feet, and diameter of the head,
seventy-four feet.</p>

<h2>THE SWEET CHESTNUT-TREE.</h2>

<p class="blockquot">
[<i>Castaneæ vulgaris.</i> Nat. Ord.&mdash;<i>Amentiferæ</i>;
 Linn.&mdash;<i>Mon&oelig;c. Poly.</i>]
</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Sweet Chestnut, so called with reference to
the fruit, in contradistinction to that of the Horse-Chestnut,
which is bitter, is also called the Spanish
Chestnut, because the best chestnuts for the table
are imported from Spain. In favourable situations,
it becomes a magnificent tree, though it never
attains a height, or diameter of head, equal to that
of the oak. The trunk generally rises erect, forming,
in all cases, a massy column of wood, in proportion
to the expansion of the head, or the height
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">[078]</a></span>
of the tree. The branches form nearly the same
angle with the trunk as those of the oak; though in
thriving trees the angle is somewhat more acute.
If planted in woods, by the road-side, and left untrimmed,
as they should be, they will be feathered
to the bottom, and will in summer, in addition to
their beautiful appearance, hide the naked stems
of other trees which are considered disagreeable
objects; while in autumn, the golden hue of the
leaves will heighten the mellow and pleasing effect
produced in the woodlands by the variety of hues
in the foliage of different trees, which contrast and
blend together in one harmonious and pictorial
aspect.</p>

<p>The Chestnut has been considered indigenous;
but this is the more doubtful, that the tree rarely
ripens its fruit, except in a climate that will ripen
the grape in the open air. On old trees, the leaves
are from four to six inches long; but on young and
vigorous shoots, they are often nearly twelve inches
in length, and from three to four inches in breadth.
They are of a rich shining green above, and paler
beneath. The flowers are produced on the wood
of the current year, and are ranged along the
common stalk, in lateral sessile tufts. The rate
of growth of young trees, in the neighbourhood of
London, averages from two to three feet for the
first ten or twelve years. The tree will attain the
height of from sixty to eighty feet in about sixty
years; but the tree will live for several centuries
afterwards, and produce abundance of fruit. The
finest trees in England are said to stand on the
banks of the Tamer, in Cornwall; and at Beechworth
Castle, in Surrey, there are seventy or eighty
Chestnuts, measuring from twelve to eighteen or
twenty feet in girth, and some of them very picturesque
in form. One, on Earl Durie's estate of
Tortworth, in Gloucestershire, is proved to have
stood ever since 1150, and to have been then remarkable
for its age and size.</p>

<p>The Chestnut is cultivated best by sowing and
setting: the nuts must, however, be left to sweat,
and then be covered with sand; after having been
thus heated for a month, plunge the nuts in water,
and reject the swimmers; then dry them for thirty
days, and repeat the process. In November, set
them as you would beans, taking care to do it in
their husks. This tree will thrive in almost all
soils and situations, though it succeeds best in
rich loamy land. Nothing will thrive beneath its
shade. Among mast-bearing trees this is said to
be the most valuable; since the nuts, when ripened
in southern climates, are considered delicacies for
princes. In this country, however, where they
rarely come to maturity, they fall to the lot of
hogs and squirrels. The trees cultivated for fruit
are generally grafted; and, in several parts of
South Europe, the peasantry are mainly supported
by bread made of the nut-flour. In Italy, in
Virgil's time, they ate them with milk and cheese:</p>

<p class="center">
Chestnuts, and curds and cream shall be our fare.
</p>

<p class="p0">And again, in his second <i>Pastoral</i>, thus translated
by Dryden:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081">[081]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
Myself will search our planted grounds at home,<br />
For downy peaches and the glossy plum;<br />
And thrash the Chestnuts in the neighbouring grove,<br />
Such as my Amaryllis used to love.<br />
</p>

<p>The timber of the Chestnut is strong and very
durable; but it is often found decayed at the core,
and, in working, is very brittle. The wood is preferred
for the manufacture of liquor tubs and
vessels, as it does not shrink after being once
seasoned. This tree is now, however, chiefly grown
for hop-poles, which are the straightest, tallest,
and most durable. Though cut at an early age
for this purpose, the trees are frequently ornaments
of our parks and pleasure-grounds.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 15em;" class="smcap">W. Browne.</span><br />
</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Elm (<i>U. campestris</i>), after having
assumed the dignity and hoary roughness of age,
is not excelled in grandeur and beauty by any of
its brethren. In this latter stage, it partakes so
much of the character of the oak, that it is easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">[083]</a></span>
mistaken for it; though the oak&mdash;such an oak as
is strongly marked with its peculiar character&mdash;can
never be mistaken for the Elm. "This defect,
however," says Gilpin, "appears chiefly in the
skeleton of the Elm. In full foliage, its character
is better marked. No tree is better adapted to
receive grand masses of light. In this respect, it is
superior both to the oak and the ash. Nor is its
foliage, shadowing as it is, of the heavy kind. Its
leaves are small, and this gives it a natural lightness;
it commonly hangs loosely, and is in general
very picturesque."</p>

<p>The Elm is not frequently met with in woods or
forests, but is more commonly planted in avenues
or other artificial situations. Cowper very accurately
sketches the variety of form in the Elm,
and alludes to the different sites where they are to
be found. In the <i>Task</i>, he first introduces them
rearing their lofty heads by the river's brink:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&mdash;There, fast rooted in his bank,</span><br />
Stand, never overlooked, our favourite Elms,<br />
That screen the herdsman's solitary hut.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Then he gives us an enchanting scene, where a
lowly cot is surrounded by them:</p>

<p class="poem">
'Tis perched upon the green hill-top, but close<br />
Environed with a ring of branching Elms,<br />
That overhang the thatch.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">He then introduces us to a grove of Elms:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&mdash;The grove receives us next;</span><br />
Between the upright shafts of whose tall Elms<br />
We may discern the thrasher at his task.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084">[084]</a></span></p>

<p>The Elm is frequently referred to by the poets.
Wordsworth thus speaks of a grove of them:</p>

<p class="poem">
Upon that open level stood a grove,<br />
The wished-for port to which my course was bound.<br />
Thither I came, and there, amid the gloom<br />
Spread by a brotherhood of lofty Elms,<br />
Appeared a roofless hut.<br />
</p>

<p>In <i>The Church Yard among the Mountains</i>, he
introduces one that seems to be the pride of the
village:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">&mdash;A wide-spread Elm</span><br />
Stands in our valley, named the <span class="smcap">JOYFUL TREE</span>;<br />
From dateless usage which our peasants hold<br />
Of giving welcome to the first of May,<br />
By dances round its trunk.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And again:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Joyful Elm</span>,</span><br />
Around whose trunk the maidens dance in May.<br />
</p>

<p>Dr. Hunter supposes that the Elm is a native of
England. Philips, however, does not agree with
this; but, admitting that the tree was known in
England as early as the Saxon times, observes,
that this does not prove the Elm to be indigenous
to the soil, confuted as it is by Nature, which
rarely allows it to propagate its species in this
country according to her common rules; while in
other countries, where the seed falls, young plants
spring up as commonly as the oaks in Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085">[085]</a></span></p>

<p class="figcaption"><i>Specific characters of U. campestris.</i> Leaves rhomboid-ovate,
acuminate, wedge-shaped, and oblique at the base, always scabrous
above, doubly and irregularly serrated, downy beneath; serratures

</div>

<p>In favourable situations, the common Elm becomes
a large timber-tree, of considerable beauty
and utility, naturally growing upright. It is the
first tree to put forth its light and cheerful green
in spring, a tint which contrasts agreeably with
the foliage of the oak, whose leaf has generally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_086" id="Page_086">[086]</a></span>
in its early state, more of an olive cast. We see
them often in fine harmony together about the end
of April and the beginning of May. The Elm is
also frequently found planted with the Scotch fir.
In spring, its light green is very discordant with
the gloomy hue of its companion; but as the year
advances, the Elm leaf takes a darker tint, and
unites in harmony with the fir. In autumn also,
the yellow leaf of the Elm mixes as kindly with
the orange of the beech, the ochre of the oak, and
many of the other fading hues of the wood.</p>

<p>The Elm was considered by the ancients of
Eastern nations as a funereal tree, as well as the
cypress. It is celebrated in the <i>Iliad</i>, for having
formed a hasty bridge, by which Achilles escaped
the Xanthus, when that river, by its overflowing,
placed him in danger of being carried away. It
has been suggested that the Romans probably introduced
it, and planted it on the graves of their
departed heroes. It was well-known among the
Latins. Virgil says, that the husbandmen bent
the young Elm, whilst growing, into the proper
shape, for their <i>buris</i> or plough-tail:</p>

<p class="poem">
Young Elms with early force in copses bow,<br />
Fit for the figure of the crooked plough.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;" class="smcap">Dryden.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Romans esteemed the Elm to be the natural
support and friend of the vine; and the feeling
that a strong sympathy subsisted between
plants, led them never to plant one without the
other. The gravest of Latin authors speak of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087">[087]</a></span>
Elm as husband of the vine; and Pliny tells us,
that that Elm is a poor spouse that does not support
three vines. This mode of marrying the vine
to the Elm gave rise to the elegant insinuation of
Vertumnus to Pomona, whose story may be found
in Ovid:</p>

<p class="poem">
"If that fair Elm," he cried, "alone should stand,<br />
No grapes would glow with gold, and tempt the hand:<br />
Or, if that vine without her Elm should grow,<br />
'Twould creep a poor neglected shrub below."<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">This union of the vine and the Elm is constantly
alluded to by the poets. Tasso, as translated by
Fairfax, says,</p>

<p class="poem">
The married Elm fell with his fruitful vine.<br />
The lofty Elm with creeping vines o'erspread.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Ovid.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Milton, narrating the occupations of Adam and
Eve before the fall, sings,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">&mdash;They led the vine</span><br />
To wed her Elm; she, spoused, about him twines<br />
Her marriageable arms, and with her brings<br />
Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn<br />
His barren leaves.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And Beaumont says,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">&mdash;The amorous vine</span><br />
Did with the fair and straight-limbed Elm entwine.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And Wordsworth, in that beautiful reflection, the
<i>Pillar of Trajan</i>, speaks of it:</p>

<p class="poem">
So, pleased with purple clusters to entwine<br />
Some lofty Elm-tree, mounts the daring vine.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">[088]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a beautiful group of Elms at Mongewell,
Oxon, which are in full vigour. The principal
one is seventy-nine feet high, fourteen feet in
girth at three feet from the ground, sixty-five in
extent of boughs, and contains two hundred and
fifty-six feet of solid timber. Strutt informs us,
that, in 1830, Dr. Barrington, the venerable Bishop
of Durham, when in his ninetieth year, erected an
urn in the midst of their shade, to the memory of
two of his friends; inscribing thereon the following
classical fragment:</p>

<p class="poem">
In this once-favoured walk, beneath these Elms,<br />
Where thickened foliage, to the solar ray<br />
Impervious, sheds a venerable gloom,<br />
Oft in instructive converse we beguiled<br />
The fervid time, which each returning year<br />
To friendship's call devoted. Such things were;<br />
But are, alas! no more.<br />
</p>

<p>The Chipstead Elm, in Kent, which is an English
tree, is a fine specimen; and is of an immense
size. It is beautiful as to form, and its trunk is
richly mantled with ivy. In Henry V.'s time, the
high road from Rye to London passed close by it,
and a fair was held annually under its branches.</p>

<p>At Sprotborough, Yorkshire, stands what is
justly regarded as the pride of the grounds&mdash;a
magnificent English Elm. This noble tree is about
fifteen feet in circumference in the bole, and still
thicker at the height of four feet from the ground,
where it divides into five enormous boughs, each
of the size of a large tree, and gracefully descending
to the ground; the whole forming a splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_089" id="Page_089">[089]</a></span>
mass of foliage, having a diameter of about forty
yards from bough to bough end.</p>

<p>The Elm is generally raised by means of suckers,
rarely from seeds. It delights in a rich, loamy
soil, thriving best in an open situation, and bears
transplantation well. It may also be planted in
good pasture grounds, as it does not injure the
grass beneath; and its leaves are agreeable to
cattle, which in some countries are chiefly supported
by them. They will eat them before oats,
and thrive well upon them. Evelyn says, that in
Herefordshire the inhabitants gathered them in
sacks for their swine and other cattle.</p>

<p class="center">
Fruitful in leaves the Elm.<br />
</p>

<p>So prolific is this tree in leaves, that it affords a
constant shade during the summer months, and for
this reason it has been planted in most of the public
and royal gardens in Europe. It is also of quick
growth, as it will yield a load of timber in little
more than forty years: it does not, however, cease
growing&mdash;if planted in a favourable situation&mdash;neither
too dry nor too moist&mdash;till it is one hundred
or one hundred and fifty years old; and it will live
several centuries.</p>

<p>The wood of the Elm is hard and tough, and is
greatly esteemed for pipes that are constantly under
ground. In London, before iron pipes were
used, the consumption of this timber for water-pipes
was enormous. It is also valuable for keels,
and planking beneath the water-line of ships, and
for mill-wheels and water-works. When long bows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">[090]</a></span>
were in fashion it was used in their manufacture,
and the Statutes recommend it for that purpose.</p>

<p>Besides <i>U. campestris</i> there are six other varieties
which have been long naturalized in this country,
the botanical descriptions of which are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>2. <i>U. suberosa</i>. Ebr. Leaves nearly orbicular, acute, obliquely
cordate at the base, sharply, regularly, and doubly serrate; always
scabrous above, pubescent below, chiefly hairy in the axillæ.
Branches spreading, bright-brown, winged with corky excrescences;
when young, very hairy. Fruit nearly round, deeply cloven,
naked. Grows in hedges, and flowers in March.</p>

<p>3. <i>U. major</i>. Smith. Leaves ovato-acuminate, very oblique at
the base, sharply, doubly, and regularly serrate; always scabrous
above, pubescent below, with dense tufts of white hairs in the
axillæ. Branches spreading, bright-brown, winged with corky
excrescences; when young, nearly smooth. Fruit obovate, slightly
cloven, naked. <i>U. hollandica</i>. Miller. Grows in hedges, and
flowers in March.</p>

<p>4. <i>U. carpinifolia</i>. Lindl. Leaves ovato-acuminate, coriaceous,
strongly veined, simply crenate, serrate, slightly oblique and
cordate at the base, shining, but rather scabrous above, smooth
beneath. Branches bright-brown, nearly smooth. Grows four
miles from Stratford-on-Avon, on the road to Alcester.</p>

<p>5. <i>U. glabra</i>. Miller. Leaves ovato-lanceolate, acuminate,
doubly and evenly crenate-serrate, cuneate and oblique at the
base, becoming quite smooth above, smooth or glandular beneath,
with a few hairs in the axillæ. Branches bright-brown, smooth,
wiry, weeping. Fruit obovate, naked, deeply cloven. &#946;. <i>glandulosa</i>.
Leaves very glandular beneath, &#947;. <i>latifolia</i>. Leaves
oblong, acute, very broad. Grows in woods and hedges; &#946;. near
Ludlow; &#947;. at West Hatch, in Essex. Flowers in March. N. B.
To this species the Downton Elm and Scampston Elm of the
nurseries probably belong.</p>

<p>6. <i>U. stricta</i>. Lindl. <i>Cornish Elm</i>. Leaves obovate, cuspidate,
cuneate at the base, evenly and nearly doubly crenate-serrate,
strongly veined, coriaceous, very smooth and shining above,

smaller, less oblique at the base, finely and regularly crenate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_091" id="Page_091">[091]</a></span>
acuminate rather than cuspidate. Grows in Cornwall and North
Devon; &#946; the less common.</p>

<p>7. <i>U. montana</i>. Bauh. <i>Witch Elm</i>. Leaves obovate, cuspidate,
doubly and coarsely serrate, cuneate and nearly equal at
the base, always exceedingly scabrous above, evenly downy
beneath. Branches not corky, cinereous, smooth. Fruit rhomboid,
oblong, scarcely cloven, naked. <i>U. campestris</i>. Willd. <i>U. effusa</i>.
Sibth., not of others. <i>U. nuda</i>. Chr. <i>U. glabra</i>, Hudson, according
to Smith. N. B. Of this, the Giant Elm and the Chichester

The Hawthorn bush, with seats beneath the shade,<br />

</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">High</span> as we admit Gilpin's taste for the picturesque
to be, we are compelled to differ from him in his
opinion of the Hawthorn. He observes that it has
little claim to picturesque beauty; he complains
that its shape is bad, that it does not taper and
point like the holly, but is a matted, round, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">[093]</a></span>
heavy bush. We are glad to find, however, that
Sir T. Lauder thinks differently; he remarks, that
"even in a picturesque point of view, it is not only
an interesting object by itself, but produces an interesting
combination, or contrast, as things may
be, when grouped with other trees. We have seen
it," he adds, "hanging over rocks, with deep
shadows over its foliage, or shooting from their
sides in the most fantastic forms, as if to gaze at
its image in the deep pool below. We have seen
it contrasting its tender green and its delicate
leaves with the brighter and deeper masses of the
holly and the alder. We have seen it growing
under the shelter, though not under the shade, of
some stately oak, embodying the idea of beauty
protected by strength. Our eyes have often caught
the motion of the busy mill-wheel, over which its
blossoms were clustering. We have seen it growing
grandly on the green of the village school, the
great object of general attraction to the young
urchins, who played in idle groups about its roots,
and perhaps the only thing remaining to be recognised
when the schoolboy returns as the man. We
have seen its aged boughs overshadowing one half
of some peaceful woodland cottage, its foliage half
concealing the window, whence the sounds of happy
content and cheerful mirth came forth. We know
that lively season</p>

<p class="poem">
When the milkmaid singeth blithe,<br />
And the mower whets his scythe,<br />
And every shepherd tells his tale<br />
Under the hawthorn in the dale.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094">[094]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">And with these, and a thousand such associations
as these, we cannot but feel emotions of no ordinary
nature when we behold this beautiful tree."
And Gilpin admits, in another part of his <i>Forest
Scenery</i>, that the Hawthorn, when entangled with
an oak, or mixing with other trees, may be beautiful.</p>

<p>Loudon describes "the Hawthorn, <i>C. oxyacantha</i>,
in its wild state, as a shrub, or small tree, with a
smooth, blackish bark, and very hard wood. The
branches are numerous and slender, furnished with
sharp, awl-shaped spines. The leaves are of a deep
smooth green, more or less deeply three-lobed,
or five-lobed, cut and serrated, wedge-shaped, or
rounded. The flowers have white petals, frequently
pink, or almost scarlet, and sweet-scented." Its
fragrance indeed is great, and its bloom is spread
over it in profusion.</p>

<p class="poem">
Marke the faire blooming of the Hawthorne tree,<br />
Who, finely cloathed in a robe of white,<br />
Fills full the wanton eye with May's delight.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;" class="smcap">Chaucer.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">While "in autumn," says Gilpin, "the Hawthorn
makes its best appearance. Its glowing berries
produce a rich tint, which often adds great beauty
to the corner of a wood, or the side of some crowded
clump."</p>

<span class="figcaption">Leaves, Flowers, and Berries of <i>C. oxyacantha.</i></span>
</div>

<p>There are many remarkable trees of this kind,
but the only one we shall here particularly mention
is Queen Mary's Thorn, which is thus described in
that splendid work, the <i>Arboretum Britannicum</i>:&mdash;"The
parent tree is in a garden near Edinburgh,
which once belonged to the Regent Murray, and
is now, 1836, in the possession of Mr. Cowan,
a paper manufacturer. It is very old, and its
branches have somewhat of a drooping character;
but whether sufficiently so to constitute a variety
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">[096]</a></span>
worth propagating as a distinct kind, appears to
us very doubtful. It may be interesting, however,
to some, to continue, by extension, the individual
tree under which the unfortunate Queen is supposed
to have spent many hours. The fruit of this
variety is rather above the middle size, long, fleshy,
of a deep red, and good to eat. The height of the
parent tree is thirty-three feet, and the diameter
of the head thirty-six feet; the trunk divides into
two limbs, at fifteen inches from the ground, one
of which is one foot four inches in diameter, and
the other one foot. The tree is healthy and vigorous,
though, if it be true that Queen Mary sat
under its shade, it must be nearly three hundred
years old."</p>

<p>The Hawthorn is found in most parts of Europe,
and appears to have been of use in England from
a very early period, as in all old works on husbandry
ample directions are given for the planting
and cultivation of the Thorn. In Tusser's <i>Five
Hundred Points in Good Husbandry</i> we find the
following directions:</p>

<p class="poem">
Go plough or delve up, advised with skill,<br />
The breadth of a ridge, and in length as you will;<br />
Where speedy quickset for a fence you will draw,<br />
To sow in the seed of the bramble and Haw.<br />
</p>

<p>If intended for seed, the haws should not be
gathered until the end of October, when they become
blackish; and even then they rarely vegetate
before the second year. The proper mode of preparing
them is as follows:&mdash;If you do not sow them
immediately, as soon as they are gathered, spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_097" id="Page_097">[097]</a></span>
them on an airy floor for five or six weeks, till the
seeds are dry and firm; then plunge them into
water, and divest them wholly of their pulp by
rubbing them between your hands with a little
sand; spread them again on the loft three or four
days, till quite dry; mix them with fine loose sandy
mould, in quantity not less than the bulk of the
seeds, and lay them in a heap against a south wall,
covering them over, three or four inches deep, with
soil of the same quality as that with which they are
mixed. If you do not sow them in the spring, in
this situation let them remain till the second spring,
as the seeds, if sown, will not appear the first year.
That the berries may be as equally mixed with the
soil as possible, turn over the heaps once in two
months, blending the covering with the seeds, and,
at every turning, give them a fresh covering in the
winter months. They should be sown the first dry
weather in February, or the beginning of March.
Separate them from the loose soil in which they
were mixed, with a wire sieve. The ground should
be good, dry, fresh land, well prepared, and the
seeds beat down with the back of a spade, and then
covered about half an inch thick with mould; or
they may be dropped in drills about eight inches
apart.</p>

<p>The utility of the Hawthorn is chiefly for fences.
The wood is hard, and the root of an old Thorn is
an excellent material for boxes and combs, and is
curiously and naturally wrought. It is white, but

high polish.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> common Hazel, <i>C. avellana</i>, is a native of all
the temperate climates of Europe and Asia, and
grows wild in almost every part of Britain, from
Cornwall to Caithness. Although never arriving
at the bulk of a timber-tree, it yet claims our
notice, among the natives of the forest, on various
accounts. Its flowers are among the first to make
their appearance, which is generally so early as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099">[099]</a></span>
the end of January, and in a month's time they are
in full bloom; these are small, and of a beautiful
red colour. Its fruit-bearing buds make a splendid
show in March, when they burst and disclose the
bright crimson of their shafts.</p>

<p>The common Hazel is known at once by its
bushy habit; by its roundish-cordate taper-pointed,
deeply serrated, light-green, downy leaves; by its
rough light-coloured bark; and by its broad leafy
husks, much lacerated and spreading at the point.
The nuts are a very agreeable fruit, abounding in a
mild oil, which is expressed and used by artists for
mixing with their colours. We must, however, caution
persons against eating too freely of this fruit,
as it is difficult of digestion, and often proves hurtful
when eaten in large quantities. They are ripe
about harvest, and we ourselves have frequently
enjoyed the pleasures of a <i>nutting</i> party, and can
fully enter into the spirit of the sketch in <i>Autumn</i>,
by our admired bard, Thomson:</p>

<p class="poem">
Ye swains, now hasten to the Hazel bank,<br />
Where, down yon dale, the wildly-winding brook<br />
Falls hoarse from steep to steep. In close array,<br />
Fit for the thickets and the tangling shrub,<br />
Ye virgins come. For you their latest song<br />
The woodlands raise; the clustering nuts for you<br />
The lover finds amid the secret shade;<br />
And, where they burnish on the topmost bough,<br />
With active vigour crushes down the tree,<br />
Or shakes them ripe from the resigning husk.<br />

<p>We must also give here a description of the
pleasures of nutting, from our favourite poet&mdash;the
poet of nature&mdash;Wordsworth:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">&mdash;It seems a day</span><br />
(I speak of one from many singled out)<br />
One of those heavenly days which cannot die;<br />
When in the eagerness of boyish hope,<br />
I left our cottage-threshold, sallying forth<br />
With a huge wallet o'er my shoulders slung,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
A nutting-crook in hand, and turned my steps<br />
Toward the distant woods.<span style="letter-spacing:1em;">  * * *</span><br />
<span style="letter-spacing:1em;">* * * *</span> Among the woods<br />
And o'er the pathless rocks I forced my way,<br />
Until at length I came to one dear nook<br />
Unvisited, where not a broken bough<br />
Drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign<br />
Of devastation! but the Hazels rose<br />
Tall and erect, with milk-white clusters hung,<br />
A virgin scene! A little while I stood,<br />
Breathing with such suppression of the heart<br />
As joy delights in; and with wise restraint,<br />
Voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed<br />
The banquet,&mdash;or beneath the trees I sate<br />
Among the flowers, and with the flowers I played.<br />
<span style="letter-spacing:1em;">* * * * * * * *</span><br />
<span style="letter-spacing:1em;">* * * * *</span> Then up I rose,<br />
And dragged on earth each branch and bough with crash<br />
And merciless ravage, and the shady nook<br />
Of Hazels, and the green and massy bower<br />
Deformed and sullied, patiently gave up<br />
Their quiet being; and unless I now<br />
Confound my present feelings with the past,<br />
Even then, when from the bower I turned away<br />
Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings,<br />
I felt a sense of pain when I beheld<br />
The silent trees, and the intruding sky.<br />
</p>

<p>The nut is a favourite food of the squirrels, which
hoard them up for winter store, being careful always
to select the best. It is commonly remarked,
that a plentiful year for nuts is the same for wheat.</p>

<p>In order to raise the Hazel, the nuts must be
gathered in autumn. These must be carefully
preserved until February in a moist place; then,
having the ground well ploughed and harrowed,
sow them in drills drawn at one yard distance.
When the young plants appear they must be kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
clear from weeds, and remain under this careful
cultivation till the weeds are no longer to be feared.
As they grow they should not be permitted to stand
too thick, but be kept thinned, until the plants are
left a yard asunder each way. Virgil says,</p>

<p class="center">
Hazels, from set and suckers, take.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">From these they thrive very well, the shoots
being of the scantling of small wands and switches,
or somewhat larger, and such as have divers hairy
twigs, which are not to be disbranched, any more
than their roots, unless by a very discreet hand.
Thus, a copse of Hazels being planted about autumn,
may be cut the next spring within three
or four inches of the ground, when new shoots
will soon grow up in clusters, and in tufts of fair
poles of twenty, or sometimes thirty feet long.
Evelyn, however, recommends that these offsets
should be allowed to grow two or three years, until
they have taken strong hold, when they may be
cut close to the very earth, the feeble ones especially.
The rate of growth, under favourable circumstances,
is from one to two feet for the first
two or three years after planting; after which, if
trained to a single stem, the tree grows slower,
attaining the height of about twelve feet in ten
years, and never growing much higher, unless
drawn up by other trees. It is seldom, however,
allowed to grow to maturity, being usually cut
down before that period.</p>

</div>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Above</span> all the evergreens which enrich our landscapes,
there is none to be compared to the common
Holly, <i>I. aquifolium</i>. This was a favourite
plant with Evelyn. It grew spontaneously and
luxuriantly near his own residence in Surrey, in a
vale anciently called Holmes' Dale, and famous
for the flight of the Danes; he expresses his wonder
that Britons seek so eagerly after foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
plants, and at a vast expense, while they neglect
the culture of this incomparable tree, whether it
be cultivated for utility or ornament. He speaks
in raptures of it: "Is there under heaven a more
glorious and refreshing object of the kind, than an
impenetrable hedge, of about four hundred feet in
length, nine feet high, and five in diameter, which
I can show in my gardens at Say's Court, Deptford,
at any time of the year, glittering with its armed
and varnished leaves; the taller standards at orderly
distances, blushing with their natural coral."</p>

<p>The leaves of the common Holly are ovate,
acute, spinous, wavy, thorny, and shining; the
lower leaves being very spinous, while the upper
ones, especially on old trees, are entire. The
flowers are white, appearing in May, and the
berries, which are red, ripen in September, and
remain on the tree all the winter.</p>

<p>Gilpin remarks that the Holly can hardly be
called a tree, though it is a large shrub, and a
plant of singular beauty; but he cannot accord
with the learned naturalist (Evelyn) in the whole
of his rapturous encomium on his hedge at Say's
Court. He recommends it, not as a hedge, but to
be planted in a forest, where, mixed with oak, or
ash, or other trees of the wood, it contributes to
form the most beautiful scenes; blending itself
with the trunks and skeletons of the winter, or
with the varied greens of summer. And as far as
an individual bush can be beautiful, the Holly is
extremely so. It has, besides, to recommend it,
that it is among the hardiest and stoutest plants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of English growth. It thrives in all soils, and in
all situations. At Dungeness, in Kent, it flourishes
even among the pebbles of the beach. It abounds,
more or less, in the remains of all aboriginal forests,
and perhaps, at present, it prevails nowhere to a
greater extent than in the remains of Needwood
Forest, in Staffordshire; there are likewise many
fine trees in the New Forest, in Hampshire. It is
also abundant on the banks of the river Findhorn,
in Aberdeenshire; but it is not very common in
Ireland, except about the lakes of Killarney, where
it attains a large size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Why Gilpin should hesitate about considering
the Holly a tree, we are at a loss to conceive, as
it grows to the height of thirty feet, and, under
cultivation, to sixty feet or upwards, and yields
timber of considerable value. Being the whitest
of all hard woods, it is useful for inlaying, especially
under thin plates of ivory, rendering the
latter more conspicuous; and also for veneering.
It is much used by the turner and mathematical
instrument maker, and for handles for the best
riding-rods, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Holly is a very valuable plant for fences;
it is seldom attacked by insects, and, if shorn,
becomes so impenetrable that birds cannot obtain
access thereto to build their nests. On these accounts
it is particularly valuable to the farmer for
hedges; the chief objection to it for this purpose
is, the slowness of its growth while young, and the
difficulty of transplanting the plants when grown
to a moderate size. Mr. Sang says, that Holly
hedges are the best for making durable fences, and
afford the greatest degree of shelter, especially
during the winter months; no plant endures the
shears better than the Holly; a hedge of it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
be carried to a great height, and consequently it
is well fitted for situations where strength and
shelter are required; it luxuriates most in a rich
sandy loam, although there are few soils in which
it will not grow. After planting, the Holly makes
but indifferent progress for a few years; but after
it becomes established in the ground, or about the
third or fourth year after planting, no fence whatever
will outgrow the Holly. "I have seen hedges,"
says Evelyn, "or stout walls, of Holly, twenty feet
high, kept upright, and the gilded sort budded
low; and in two or three places one above another,
shorn and fashioned into columns and pilasters,
architecturally shaped, and at due distance; than
which nothing can possibly be more pleasant, the
berry adorning the intercolumniations with scarlet
festoons and encarpa." The employment of the
Holly at Christmas for ornamenting churches and
dwelling-houses, is believed to have come down to
us from the Druids, who made use of it in their
religious ceremonies. The name Holly is supposed
to be a corruption of the word <i>holy</i>, as Dr. Turner,
one of the earliest English writers on plants, calls
it <span style="position: relative; bottom:-.4em"><img src="images/holy.png" width="37" height="18" alt="holy" title="holy" /></span>,
and <span style="position: relative; bottom:-.4em"><img src="images/holy_tree.png" width="71" height="18" alt="holy tree" title="holy tree" /></span>,
which appellation was probably
given to it on account of its use in holy places;
the German name, Christdorn, the Danish name,
Christorn, and the Swedish name, Christtorn, seem
to justify this conjecture. It is also styled Holy
in a carol written in its praise in the time of
Henry VI., preserved in the Harleian MSS., No.
5396, and printed in Loudon's <i>Arboretum</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">

<p>The disciples of Zoroaster believe that the sun
never shadows the Holly-tree; and there are still
some followers of this king in Persia, who throw
water which has been in the bark of the Holly in
the face of new-born children. Southey, in a very
elegant poem, which is printed in the <i>Sentiment of
Flowers</i>, in the article entitled Foresight, of which
quality the Holly is considered emblematical, has
noticed the circumstance of the lower leaves of
large plants being spinous, while the upper are
entire.</p>

<h2>THE HORNBEAM.</h2>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> <i>Carpinus</i>. Barren catkin long, cylindrical. Scales roundish.
Stamens 5 to 14. Anther 1-celled. Fertile flower in a lax catkin.
Scales large, leaf-like, 3-lobed, 2-flowered. Styles 2. Nut
ovate, 1-seeded.</p>
</div>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Hornbeam, <i>C. betulus</i>, is a native of
England and Ireland, and of the south of Scotland,
and is also indigenous throughout the greater part
of Europe and western Asia, but not in Africa.
Picturesquely considered, the Hornbeam is very
nearly allied to the beech. When suffered to grow
it will be like it, and attain to a great height, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a fine straight trunk; it is very common in many
parts of England, but is rarely allowed to become
a timber-tree, being generally pollarded by the
country people. It is, therefore, usually seen only
in clipped hedges, where it is very obedient to the
knife, and, with a little care, will never presume to
appear out of form. It is excellent for forming
tall hedges, or screens, in nursery grounds or ornamental
gardens. That admirable <i>espalier</i> hedge
in the long middle walk of Luxemburg garden at
Paris (than which there is nothing more graceful),
is planted of this tree; and so is that cradle, or
close walk, with that perplexed canopy which
covers the seat in her Majesty's garden at Hampton
Court; these hedges are tonsile, but where
they are maintained to fifteen or twenty feet in
height (which is very frequent in the places before
mentioned), they are to be cut and kept in order
with a scythe of four feet long, and very little falcated;
this is fixed on a long sneed, or straight
handle, and does wonderfully expedite the trimming
of these and the like hedges.</p>

<p>The leaves of the Hornbeam somewhat resemble
those of the elm, but are smoother; they are cordate,
doubly serrate, pointed, plaited when young, and
have numerous parallel, transverse, hairy ribs;
their colour is a darkish green, changing to a russet
brown in autumn, and they remain on the tree,
like those of the beech, till spring. The buds are
rather long and pointed. The flowers appear at
the same time as the leaves. The male catkins
are loose, scaly, of a yellowish colour, and about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
two or three inches long; the female catkins are
much smaller, and, when young, are covered with
close brownish scales, which gradually increase,
and form unequally three-lobed, sharply serrated,
veiny, dry, pale-green bracts, each enveloping an
angular nut, scarcely bigger than a grain of barley.
These nuts ripen in October, and fall with the capsules.
The bark of the Hornbeam is light-gray
and smooth, and the wood very white, tough, and
strong. It is used for yokes, handles for tools,
and cogs for mill-wheels; it is also much valued
by the turner. It is very inflammable, and will burn
like a candle, for which purpose it was formerly
employed. The inner bark is much used in the
north of Europe for dyeing yellow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>When raised from seed, the common Hornbeam
acquires the usual magnitude of the beech, to
which, as before stated, it is similar in its appearance.
In the neighbourhood of London the
rate of growth may be considered from twelve to
eighteen inches a-year for the first ten years, and
the tree will attain its full size in between fifty and
sixty years; its longevity may be considered as
equal to that of the beech. Hanbury says that
this tree is peculiarly grateful to hares and rabbits;
and if so, the planting of it among other trees and
shrubs might be the means of saving them from
being injured by these creatures. The Hornbeam
preserves itself from the butting of the deer, by its
mode of throwing out its branches; on this account
it should be cultivated in parks, as well as for its
beauty and shelter. The regular growth of the
Hornbeam is referred to by Fawkes, in his <i>Bramham
Park</i>:</p>

<p class="poem">
Here spiry firs extend their lengthened ranks,<br />
There violets blossom on the sunny banks;<br />
Here Hornbeam hedges regularly grow,<br />
There hawthorn whitens and wild roses blow.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hornbeam is recommended to be planted
on cold, barren hills, as in such situations it will
flourish where few other trees will grow; it also
resists the winds much better than the generality
of trees, and, at the same time, it is not slow of
growth. In such situations, Dr. Hunter observes
that he noticed some specimens nearly seventy
feet high, having large, noble stems, perfectly
straight and sound.</p>

<p>There was a fine specimen of this tree at Bargoly,
in Galloway, which measured, in 1780, six
feet two inches in circumference. It had twenty
feet of clear trunk, and was seventy feet high.</p>

<h2>THE HORSE-CHESTNUT TREE.</h2>

<p class="blockquot">
[<i>Æsculus.</i> Nat. Ord.&mdash;<i>Æsculaceæ</i>; Linn.&mdash;<i>Heptan. Monog.</i>]
</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Horse-chestnut, <i>Æ. hippocastanum</i>, is
supposed to be a native of the north of India, and
appears to have been introduced into England
about the year 1575. It is a tree of the largest
size, with an erect trunk and a pyramidal head.
It forms its foliage generally in a round mass, with
little appearance of those breaks which are so
much to be admired, and which contribute to give
an airiness and lightness, at least a richness and
variety, to the whole mass of foliage. This tree is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
however, chiefly admired for its flower, which in
itself is beautiful; but the whole tree together in
flower is a glaring object, totally unharmonious
and unpicturesque. In some situations, indeed,
and amidst a profusion of other wood, a single
Horse-chestnut or two in bloom may be beautiful.
As it forms an admirable shade, it may be of use,
too, in thickening distant scenery, or in screening
an object at hand; for there is no species of foliage,
however heavy, nor any species of bloom,
however glaring, which may not be brought, by
some proper contrast, to produce a good effect. It
is generally, however, considered one of the most
ornamental trees in our plantations. Evelyn styles
it a tree of singular beauty and use; and Miss
Twamley, in her elegant volume, the <i>Romance of
Nature</i>, breaks into raptures in speaking of it.
"Few trees," she says, "are so magnificent in
foliage as the Horse-chestnut, with its large fan-like
leaves, far more resembling those of some
tropical plant than the garb of a forest-tree in
climes like ours; but when these are crowned with
its pyramids of flowers, so splendid in their distant
effect, and so exquisitely modelled and pencilled
when we gather and examine their fair forms&mdash;is
it not then the pride of the landscape? If the
Oak&mdash;the true British Oak&mdash;be the forest king,
let us give him at least a partner in his majesty;
and let the Chestnut, whose noble head is crowned
by the hand of spring with a regal diadem, gemmed
with myriads of pearly, and golden, and ruby
flowers, let her be queen of the woods in bonny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
England; and while we listen to the musical hum
of bees, as they load themselves with her wealth of
honey, we will fancy they are congratulating their
noble and generous friend on her new honours."</p>

<p>The leaves of the Horse-chestnut are large, of a
deep green colour, fine, and palmated, and appear
very early in the spring; it is naturally uniform in
its growth. In the spring it produces long spikes,
with beautiful flowers white and variegated, generally
in such number as to cover the whole tree,
and to give it the appearance of one gigantic
bouquet. No flowering shrub is rendered more gay
by its blossoms than this tall tree; thus it combines
beauty with grandeur, in a degree superior to any
other vegetable of these climates. In Howitt's <i>Forest
Minstrel</i>, we find the following poetical allusion:</p>

<p class="poem">
For in its honour prodigal nature weaves<br />
A princely vestment, and profusely showers,<br />
O'er its green masses of broad palmy leaves,<br />
Ten thousand waxen pyramidal flowers;<br />
And gay and gracefully its head it heaves<br />
Into the air, and monarch-like it towers.<br />
</p>

<p>The buds of this tree, before they shoot out
leaves, become turgid and large, so that they have
a good effect to the eye long before the leaves appear;
and it is peculiar to the Horse-chestnut, that
as soon as the leading shoot is come out of the
bud, it continues to grow so fast as to be able to
form its whole summer's shoot in about three
weeks' or a month's time: after this it grows little
or nothing more in length, but thickens, and becomes
strong and woody, and forms the buds for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the next year's shoot; the leaves are blunt, spear-shaped,
and serrated, growing by sevens on one
stalk, the middle one longest. The flowers are in
full blossom about May, and, on fine trees, make
a pleasing appearance; they continue in bloom for
a month or more.</p>

<p class="poem">
In June that Chestnut shot its blossomed spires<br />
Of silver upward 'mid the foliage dark;<br />
As if some sylvan deity had hung<br />
Its dim umbrageousness with votive wreaths.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Thus, Mr. Moir's Horse-chestnut put forth its
bloom in June. The fruit ripens about the end of
September or the beginning of October.</p>

<p>We quote the following singular fact from the
<i>Magazine of Natural History</i>:&mdash;"The downy interior
of the Horse-chestnut buds are: protected from the
wet by a covering of a gummy substance. Miss Kent
says, 'that we cannot have a better specimen of
the early formation of plants in their bud than in
that of the Horse-chestnut.' A celebrated German
naturalist detached from this tree, in the
winter season, a flower bud not larger than a pea,
and first took off the external covering, which he
found consisted of seventeen scales; having removed
these scales, and the down which formed
the internal covering of the bud, he discovered four
branch leaves surrounding a spike of flowers, the
latter of which was so distinctly visible, that, with
the aid of a microscope, he not only counted sixty-eight
flowers, but could discern the pollen of the
stamens, and perceive that some were opaque and
some transparent. This experiment may be tried
by any one, as the flowers may be perceived with
a common magnifying glass; but as detaching the
scales requires care, it would be advisable for an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
unpractised student to gather the bud in early
spring, when the sun is just beginning to melt
away the gum with which the scales are sealed
together."</p>

<p>The Horse-chestnut is extremely well adapted to
parks, not only because it grows to a large size
and forms a beautiful regular head, thereby becoming
a pleasing object at a distance, but also on
account of the quantity of nuts it yields, which are
excellent food for deer, so that where great numbers
of deer are kept, the planting of these trees in
abundance is to be recommended. It is also very
suitable for avenues, or walks, though it has been
objected that its leaves fall early in the autumn.
This must be admitted; yet we think it fully
compensates for the loss by the exhibition of its
light-brown nuts, some on the ground, some ready
to fall, and others just peeping out of their cells.
The finest avenue of these trees in England is that
at Bushy Park.</p>

<p>There are many fine specimens of this tree in
various parts of the country. In Suffolk, at Finborough
Hall, one, eighty years planted, is one
hundred feet high; the diameter of its trunk, at
one foot from the ground, is five feet. In the
church-yard at Bolton-on-Dearne, in Yorkshire,
there are some fine specimens; one sixty-six feet
high, and two feet eight inches in diameter at the
ground; and another sixty-eight feet high, and two
feet six inches in diameter. But the largest in
Britain is said to be at Trocton, in Lincolnshire,
fifty-nine feet high. Loudon says this is a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
magnificent tree, with immense branches extending
over the space of three hundred and five feet,
in circumference; and the branches are so large
as to require props, so that at a little distance it
looks like an Indian banyan tree.</p>

<p>The Horse-chestnut is propagated from the nut,
of which a sufficient quantity should be gathered
as they fall from the trees, and soon afterwards
either sown or mixed up with earth, until the
spring; because, if exposed to the atmosphere,
they will lose their germinating power in a month.
After being transplanted into the nursery, and
having there attained a sufficient size, the young
trees must be taken out with care, the great side
shoots and bruised parts of the roots lopped off,
and then planted in large holes, level with the surface
of the ground at the top of their roots, the
fibres being all spread and lapped in the fine mould,
and the turf also worked to the bottom: October
is the best season for this work. Like most other
trees, this delights in good fat land, but it will grow
exceedingly well on clayey and marly grounds;
large trees have been known to look luxuriant and
healthy in very cold barren earth. It will attain
a very large size in a few years.</p>

<p>The timber of this tree is not very valuable,
especially where great strength is required, nor
will it bear exposure to the air. It is, however, of
some use to the turner, and also serviceable for
flooring, linings to carts, &amp;c. Du Hamel recommends
it as suitable for water-pipes, which are kept
constantly underground. The fruit is of a farinaceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
quality, but so bitter as to be useless for
food. Goats, sheep, and deer are said to be very
fond of them; the bark has considerable astringency,
and may be used for tanning leather. A
decoction of the rind will dye the hair of a golden
hue.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Larch claims the Alps and Apennines for
its native country, where it thrives in higher regions
of the air than any known tree of its large
bulk, hanging over rocks and precipices which
have never been trod by human feet. It is often
felled by the Alpine peasant, to fall athwart some
yawning chasm, where it affords an awful passage
from cliff to cliff, while the roaring cataract below,
is only seen in surges of vapour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The Larch is first mentioned as growing in England
in 1629, but it did not become plentiful in
nurseries until 1759. It is stated, in the <i>Transactions
of the Highland Society</i> (vol. xi. p. 169), that
it was first planted as a forest-tree at Goodwood,
the seat of the Duke of Richmond, near Chichester;
but it was not until after 1784, on the Society
of Arts offering gold medals and premiums for its
cultivation, that it became generally planted. The
following are some of the largest numbers of trees
planted about that time by the respective parties:&mdash;The
Bishop of Llandaff, 48,500, on the high
grounds near Ambleside, in Westmoreland; W.
Mellish, Esq. of Blythe, 47,500; George Wright,
Esq. of Gildingwells, 11,573; and the late Earl of
Fife, 181,813, in the county of Moray, in Scotland.
The same spirit for planting this tree has continued
to the present time, wherever the land has not been
thought more valuable for other purposes. In
1820 the Society for promoting Arts, &amp;c., presented
his Grace the Duke of Devonshire with the gold
medal, for planting 1,981,065 forest-trees, 980,128
of which were Larch.</p>

<p>Of the introduction of the Larch into Scotland,
it is stated by Headrick, in his <i>Survey of Forfarshire</i>:
"It is generally supposed that Larches
were brought into Scotland by one of the Dukes
of Athol; but I saw three Larches of extraordinary
size and age, in the garden near the mansion-house
of Lockhart of Lee, on the northern banks of the
Clyde, a few miles below Lanark. The stems and
branches were so much covered with lichens, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
they hardly exhibited any signs of life or vegetation.
The account I heard of them was, that
they were brought there by the celebrated Lockhart
of Lee (who had been ambassador from Cromwell
to France), soon after the restoration of
Charles II. (about 1660). After Cromwell's death,
thinking himself unsafe on account of having
served the usurper, he retired for some time into
the territories of Venice; he there observed the
great use the Venetians made of Larches in ship-building,
in piles for buildings, in the construction
of their houses, and for other purposes; and when
he returned home, he brought a great number of
large plants, in pots, in order to try if they could be
gradually made to endure the climate of Scotland.
He nursed his plants in hot-houses, and in a greenhouse,
sheltered from the cold, until they all died
except the three alluded to. These, in desperation,
he planted in the warmest and best sheltered
part of his garden, where they attained an extraordinary
height and growth."</p>

</div>

<p>The Common Larch, <i>A. Larix</i>, may be described
as "a tree, rising in favourable situations
on the Alps, and also in Britain, from eighty to
one hundred feet in height, with a trunk from three
to four feet in diameter, and having a conical head.
<i>Branches</i> subverticillate, and spreading horizontally
from the straight trunk; occasionally, however,
rather pendulous, particularly when old. <i>Branchlets</i>
more or less pendulous. <i>Leaves</i> linear, soft,
blunt, or rounded at the points, of an agreeable
light green colour; single or fasciculated; in the
latter case many together round a central bud;
spreading, and slightly recurved. <i>Male catkins</i>
without foot-stalks, globular, or slightly oblong, of
a light yellow colour; and, together with the
<i>female catkins</i>, or young cones, appearing in April
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and the beginning of May; the latter varying from
a whitish to a bright red colour. <i>Cones</i> of an oblong,
ovate shape, erect, full one inch in length,
and of a brownish colour when ripe. <i>Scales</i> persistent,
roundish, striated, and generally slightly
waved, but not distinctly notched on the margin.
<i>Bracts</i> generally longer than the scales, particularly
towards the base of the cones. <i>Seeds</i> of an irregular
or ovate form, fully one-eighth of an inch long,
and more than half-surrounded by the smooth,
shining, persistent pericarp. Cotyledons five to
seven."&mdash;<i>Lawson's Manual.</i></p>

<p>In the <i>Memoirs of the Royal Society of Agriculture
at Paris</i>, for the year 1787, there is an Essay by
M. le President de la Tour d'Aigues, on the culture
of the Larch, in which it is celebrated as one of the
most useful of all timber trees. He tells us that
in his own garden he has rails which were put up
in the year 1743, partly of oak and partly of Larch.
The former, he says, have yielded to time, but the
latter are still sound. And in his Castle of Tour
d'Aigues he has Larchen beams of twenty inches
square, which are sound, though above two hundred
years old. The finest trees he knows of this
kind, grew in some parts of Dauphiny, and in
the forest of Baye, in Provence, where there are
Larches, he tells us, which two men cannot encompass.</p>

<p>The timber is valuable for many purposes. It
is said, that old dry Larch will take such a polish
as to become almost transparent, and that, in this
state, it may be wrought into very beautiful wainscot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
In our encomium of the Larch we must not
omit that the old painters used it, more than any
other wood, to paint on, before the use of canvas
became general. Many of Raphael's pictures are
painted on boards of Larch. It is also used by
the Italians for picture-frames, because no other
wood gives gilding such force and brilliancy. We
are told that this is the reason why their gilding
on wood is so much superior to ours.</p>

<p>In Switzerland they cover the roofs of their
houses with shingles made of Larch. These are
usually cut about one foot square and half an inch
in thickness, which they nail to the rafters. At
first the roof appears white, but in the course of
two or three years it becomes as black as coal, and
all the joints are stopped by the resin which the
sun extracts from the pores of the wood. This
shining varnish renders the roof impenetrable to
wind or rain: this is the chief covering, and, some
say, an incombustible one. From the Larch, too, is
extracted what is commonly called Venice turpentine.
This substance, or natural balsam, flows at
first without incision; when it has done dropping
the poor people make incisions, at about two or
three feet from the ground, into the trunk of the
trees, and into these they fix narrow troughs, about
twenty inches long; the end of these troughs is
hollow, like a ladle, and in the middle is a small
hole bored for the turpentine to run into a receiver
which is placed below it. The people who gather
it, visit the tree, morning and evening, from the
end of May to September, to collect the turpentine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
out of the receivers. When it flows out of
the tree the turpentine is clear like water, and
of a yellowish white; but as it becomes older it
thickens, and changes to a citron colour. It is
procured in great abundance in the neighbourhood
of Lyons, and in the valley of St. Martin, near
Lucerne, Switzerland. It is only after the tree
has attained the thickness of ten or twelve inches
in diameter, that it is thought worth while to collect
the turpentine; and if the tree remain in
vigorous growth, it will continue, for forty or fifty
years, to yield annually seven or eight pounds of
turpentine.</p>

<p>The cones of the Larch, intended for seed, ought
to be gathered towards the latter end of November,
and then kept in a dry place till the following
spring, when, being spread on a cloth and exposed
to the sun, or laid before the fire, the scales will
open and shed their seed. These should be sown
on a border exposed to the east, where they will
be affected by the morning sun only, as the plants
do not prosper so well where the sun lies much on
them. In autumn the young plants may be pricked
out into other beds, as soon as they have shed their
leaves, at the distance of six inches each way. In
two years the young trees will be ready to plant
where they are intended to stand; then they need
not be more than eight or ten feet apart from each
other, but at less distance on exposed situations.
It is now well-known, that the Larch will grow in
wild and barren situations better than in a luxuriant
soil; and this tree is even apt to grow top-heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in too much shelter and nourishment. No
tree has been introduced into Britain with such
remarkable success as the Larch. Phillips says,
"The face of our country has, within the last thirty
years, been completely changed by the numerous
plantations of Larch that have sprung up on every
barren spot of these kingdoms, from the southern
shores to the extremity of the north, and from the
Land's End to the mouth of the Thames. So great
has been the demand for young trees of this species
of pine, that one nurseryman in Edinburgh raised
above five million of these trees in the year 1796.
We have introduced no exotic tree that has so
greatly embellished the country in general. Its
pale and delicate green, so cheerfully enlivening
the dark hue of the fir and the pine, and its elegant
spiral shape, contrasting with the broad-spreading
oak, is a no less happy contrast; whilst
its stars of fasciculate foliage are displayed to
additional advantage, when neighbouring with the
broad-leaved æsculus, the glossy holly, the drooping
birch, or the tremulous aspen."</p>

<p>Sir T. D. Lauder considers that "The Larch is
unquestionably by much the most enduring timber
we have. It is remarkable, that whilst red
wood or heart wood is not formed at all in the
other resinous trees till they have lived for many
years, the larch, on the other hand, begins to make
it soon after it is planted; and whilst you may fell a
Scotch fir of thirty years old, and find no red wood
in it, you can hardly cut down a young Larch
large enough to be a walking-stick, without finding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
just such a proportion of red wood, compared
to its diameter as a tree, as you will find in the
largest Larch in the forest, when compared to its
diameter. To prove the value of the Larch as a
timber-tree, we believe, at the suggestion of the
then Duke of Athol, posts of equal thickness and
strength, some of Larch and others of oak, were
driven down facing the river-wall, where they were
alternately covered with water by the effect of the
tide, and left dry by its fall. This species of alternation
is the most trying of all circumstances for
the endurance of timber, and accordingly the
oaken posts decayed, and were twice renewed in
the course of a very few years, whilst those which
were made of Larch remained altogether unchanged."
Of the Larch, Mr. Sang remarks that
it "bears the ascendency over the Scotch pine in
the following important circumstances: that it
brings double the price, at least per measurable
foot; that it will arrive at a useful timber size in
one half, or a third part, of the time in general
which the fir requires; and, above all, that the
timber of the Larch, at thirty or forty years old,
when planted in a soil and climate adapted to the
production of perfect timber, is, in every respect,
superior in quality to that of the fir at a hundred
years old." On experimental observation, the
Larch has been found, in Scotland, to increase
annually, at six feet from the ground, about one
inch and a half in circumference, on the trunks of
trees from ten to fifty years of age. In the course
of fifty years the tree will attain the height of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
eighty feet or upwards; and, in its native habitats,
according to Willdenow, "it lives from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred years."</p>

<p>"Though we should least expect to find such
a quality in a resinous tree like the Larch, it has
been proved to make a beautiful hedge, and to submit
with wonderful patience to the shears. We
once saw a very pretty fence of this description in a
gentleman's pleasure-grounds near Loch Lomond.
The trees were planted at equal distances from each
other, and being clipped, were half cut through
towards the top, and bent down over each other,
and, in, many instances, the top shoot of one had
insinuated itself into that adjacent to it, so as to
have become corporeally united to it; and, strange
as it may seem, we actually found one top that
had so inserted itself, which, having been rather
deeply cut originally by the hedge-bill, had actually
detached itself from its parent stock, and was
now growing, grafted on the other, with the lower
part of it pointing upwards into the air!"&mdash;<i>Sir
T. D. Lauder.</i></p>

<p>There are ten or more varieties of the Larch in
cultivation, but as these are probably only different
forms of the same species, it is unnecessary to
enumerate them.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Lime-tree grows naturally straight
and taper, with a smooth erect trunk, and a fine
spreading head, inclining to a conical form. In
a good soil it arrives at a great height and size,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and becomes a majestic object. Thus we read
that</p>

<p class="poem">
The stately Lime, smooth, gentle, straight, and fair,<br />
With which no other dryad may compare,<br />
With verdant locks and fragrant blossoms decked,<br />
Does a large, even, odorate shade project.<br />
</p>

<p>This beautiful tree is a native of the middle and
north of Europe, and is said to have been highly
esteemed among the Romans for its shade. Evelyn
praises the Lime as being the most proper and
beautiful for walks; as producing an upright
body, smooth and even bark, ample leaves, sweet
blossom, and a goodly shade, at the distance of
eighteen or twenty feet. Those growing in St.
James's Park, London, are said to have been
planted at his suggestion. There are now many
avenues of Limes in various parts of the country.
At the termination of one at Colerton, Leicestershire,
there is placed an urn with the following
tribute to the memory of Sir Joshua Reynolds,
written by Wordsworth at the request of the proprietor,
Sir George Beaumont, Bart.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Ye Lime-trees, ranged before this hallowed urn,<br />
Shoot forth with lively power at spring's return;<br />
And be not slow a stately growth to rear<br />
Of pillars, branching off from year to year,<br />
Till they have learned to frame a darksome aisle,&mdash;<br />
That may recal to mind that awful pile<br />
Where Reynolds, 'mid our country's noblest dead,<br />
In the last sanctity of fame is laid.<br />
There, though by right the excelling painter sleep,<br />
Where death and glory a joint Sabbath keep;<br />
Yet not the less his spirit would hold dear<br />
Self-hidden praise, and friendship's private tear;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Hence, on my patrimonial grounds, have I<br />
Raised this frail tribute to his memory;<br />
From youth a zealous follower of the art<br />
That he professed, attached to him in heart;<br />
Admiring, loving, and with grief and pride,<br />
Feeling what England lost when Reynolds died.<br />
</p>

<p>Loudon speaks of two ancient Lime-trees at
Zoffingen, on the branches of which is placed a
plank, in such a manner as to enable any one to
walk from the one to the other; and thus people
may not only walk, but even dance, upon the foliage
of the tree. In the village of Villars en Morig,
near Fribourg, there is a large Lime which existed
there long before the battle of Morat (1476), and
which is now of extraordinary dimensions; it
was, in 1831, seventy feet high, and thirty-six feet
in circumference at four feet from the ground,
where it divided into large and perfectly sound
branches. It must be nearly a thousand years
old. And at Fribourg, in the public square, there
is a large Lime, the branches of which are supported
by pieces of wood. This tree was planted
on the day when the victory was proclaimed of the
Swiss over the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the
Bold, in the year 1476; and it is a monument
admirably accordant with the then feebleness of
the Swiss republics, and the extreme simplicity
of their manners. In 1831 the trunk of this
tree measured thirteen feet nine inches in circumference.</p>

<p>Botanically considered, the Common Lime is a
large and handsome tree with spreading branches,
thickly clothed with leaves twice the length of their
petioles, cordate at the base, serrate, pointed,
smooth&mdash;except a woolly tuft at the origin of each
nerve beneath&mdash;unequal and entire at the base;
stipules oval, smooth, in pairs at the base of each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
foot-stalk; flower-stalks axillar, cymose, each bearing
an oblong, pale, smooth bract, united, for half
its length, with the stalk; flowers of a greenish
colour, growing in clusters of four or five together,
and highly fragrant, especially at night. This
renders them very attractive to the bees, which is
referred to by Virgil, in his beautiful description
of the industrious Corycian, thus translated by
Martyn:&mdash;"He therefore was the first to abound
with pregnant bees, and plentiful swarms, and to
squeeze the frothing honey from the combs. He
had Limes, and plenty of pines; and as many fruits
as showed themselves in early blossom, so many
did he gather ripe in early autumn."&mdash;<i>Geo.</i> iv. 127.</p>

<p>The seeds of the Linden-tree rarely ripen in
Britain; this tree is, therefore, properly propagated
by layers, which must be made in the nursery
in autumn; in one year they become rooted
so as to allow of being removed. It will grow well
in any soil or situation, but if planted in a rich
loamy earth, the rapidity of its growth will be
almost incredible. The timber of the Lime-tree
is very serviceable, and much preferable to that of
the willow, being stronger yet lighter. Because of
its colour, which is of a pale yellow or white, and
its easy working, and not being liable to split,
architects form with it their models for buildings.
The most elegant use to which it is applied is for
carving, not only for small figures, but large
statues in basso and alto relievo, as that of the
Stoning of St. Stephen, with the structures and
elevations about it; the trophies, festoons, fruitages,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
friezes, capitals, pedestals, and other ornaments
and decorations about the choir of St. Paul's,
executed by Gibbons, and other carvings by the
same artist at Chatsworth, the seat of the Duke of
Devonshire, and in Trinity College Library at
Cambridge. It is even supposed by some that the
blocks employed by Holbein, for wood engravings,
were of this tree. Dodsley says&mdash;</p>

<p class="p0">It is used by piano-forte makers for sounding-boards,
and by cabinet-makers for a variety of
purposes. The wood is also said to make excellent
charcoal for gunpowder, even better than alder,
and nearly as good as hazel, while baskets and
cradles are made with the twigs of the Lime; and
of the smoother side of the bark, tablets for writing;
for the ancient Philyra is but our Tilia, of which
Munting affirms he saw a book, made of the inner
bark, written about 1000 years ago; such another
was brought to the Count of St. Amant, governor
of Arras, 1662, for which there were given 8000
ducats by the Emperor. It contains a work of
Cicero, <i>De ordinanda Republica et de Inveniendis
Orationum Exordiis</i>, which is still unprinted, and
is now in the imperial library of Vienna, after
having been the greatest rarity in that of the
celebrated Cardinal Mazarin, who died in 1661.

The smoothness of the Lime-tree is thus alluded
to by Cowper in the <i>Task</i>:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">Here the gray smooth trunks</span><br />
Of ash, or Lime, or beech, distinctly shine<br />
Within the twilight of their distant shades,<br />
There lost behind a rising ground, the wood<br />
Seems sunk and shortened to its topmost boughs.<br />
</p>

<p>This peculiarity of the bark has also been noticed
by Leigh Hunt, in the story of <i>Rimini</i>:</p>

<p class="poem">
Places of nestling green for poets made,<br />
Where, when the sunshine struck a yellow shade,<br />
The slender trunks to inward peeping sight,<br />
Thronged, in dark pillars, up the gold-green light.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">The leaves of the Lime-tree are also useful, and
were esteemed so in common with those of the elm
and poplar, both in a dried and green state for
feeding cattle, by the Romans.</p>

<p>The other two indigenous or naturalized species
of Lime are&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <i>The broad-leaved, T. grandifolia.</i> Ehrh. Flowers without
nectaries; leaves roundish, cordate, pointed, serrate, downy, especially
beneath, with hairy tufts at the origin of the veins; capsule
turbinate, with prominent angles, downy.&mdash;&mdash;<i>Flowers</i> in August:
found in woods and hedges.</p>

<p>3. <i>The small-leaved, T. parvifolia.</i> Ehrh. Flowers without
nectaries; leaves scarcely longer than their petioles, roundish,
cordate, serrate, pointed, glaucous beneath, with hairy tufts at the
origin of the veins, and scattered hairy blotches; capsule roundish,
with slender ribs, thin, brittle, nearly smooth.&mdash;&mdash;<i>A handsome</i>
tree, distinguished from the former by its much smaller leaves and
flowers: germen densely woolly: flowers in August: grows in
woods in Essex, Sussex, &amp;c.: frequent.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Maple (<i>A. campestre</i>) is found throughout
the middle states of Europe, and in the north
of Asia. It is common in hedges and thickets in
the middle and south of England, but is rare in
the northern counties and in Scotland, and is not
indigenous in Ireland. It is a rather small tree, of
no great figure, so that it is seldom seen employed
in any nobler service than in filling up a part in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hedge, in company with thorns and briers. In a
few instances, where it is met with in a state of
maturity, its form appears picturesque. It is not
much unlike the oak, only it is more bushy, and its
branches are closer and more compact. Although
it seldom attains a height of more than twenty feet,
yet in favourable situations it rises to forty feet,
as may be seen in Eastwell Park, Kent, and in
Caversham Park, near Reading. The Rev. William
Gilpin, from whose <i>Remarks on Forest Scenery</i> we
have derived much interesting matter, is buried
under the shade of a very large Maple in the church-yard
of Boldre, in the New Forest, Hampshire.</p>

<p>The botanical characters of <i>A. campestre</i> are:&mdash;<i>Leaves</i>
about one and a half inch in width, downy
while young, as are their foot-stalks, obtusely five-lobed,
here and there notched, sometimes quite
entire. Flowers green, in clusters that terminate
the young shoots, hairy, erect, short, and somewhat
corymbose. Anthers hairy between the lobes. Capsules
downy, spreading horizontally, with smooth,
oblong, reddish wings. Bark corky, and full of
fissures; that of the branches smooth. Flowers
in May and June.</p>

<p>The ancients held this tree in great repute.
Ovid compares it to the Lime:</p>

<p class="poem">
The Maple not unlike the lime-tree grows,<br />
Like her, her spreading arms abroad she throws,<br />
Well clothed with leaves, but that the Maple's bole<br />
Is clad by nature with a ruder stole.<br />

<p class="p0">Pliny speaks as highly of its knobs and its excrescences,
called the <i>brusca</i> and <i>mollusca</i>, as Dr. Plot
does of those of the ash. The veins of these excrescences
in the Maple, Pliny tells us, were so
variegated that they exceeded the beauty of any
other wood, even of the citron; though the citron
was in such repute at Rome, that Cicero, who was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
neither rich nor expensive, was tempted to give
10,000 sesterces for a citron table. The brusca
and mollusca, Pliny adds, were rarely of a size
sufficient for the larger species of furniture, but in
all smaller cabinet-work they were inestimable.
Indeed, the whole tree was esteemed by the ancients
on account of its variegated wood, especially
the white, which is singularly beautiful. This is
called the French Maple, and grows in northern
Italy, between the Po and the Alps; the other has
a curled grain, so curiously spotted, that it was
called, from a near resemblance, the peacock's
tail. So mad were people formerly in searching
for the representations of birds, beasts, and other
objects in the bruscum of this tree, that they
spared no expense in procuring it.</p>

<p>The timber is used for musical instruments, inlaying,
&amp;c., and is reckoned superior to most woods
for turnery ware. Our poets generally place a
Maple dish in every hermitage they speak of.</p>

<p class="poem">
Methinks that to some vacant hermitage<br />
My feet would rather turn,&mdash;to some dry nook<br />
Scooped out of living rock, and near a brook<br />
Hurled down a mountain-cave, from stage to stage,<br />
Yet tempering, for my sight, its bustling rage<br />
In the soft haven of a translucent pool;<br />
Thence creeping under forest arches cool,<br />
Fit haunt of shapes whose glorious equipage<br />
Would elevate my dreams. A beechen bowl,<br />
A Maple dish, my furniture should be;<br />
Crisp, yellow leaves my bed; the hooting owl<br />
My night-watch; nor should e'er the crested fowl<br />
From thorp or vil his matins sound for me,<br />
Tired of the world and all its industry.<br />

</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">Wilson and Cowper also furnish the hermit's cell
with a Maple dish, while Mason notes one that
lacked this article, deemed so requisite for such a
habitation:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;Many a visitant</span><br />
Had sat within his hospitable cave;<br />
From his Maple bowl, the unpolluted spring<br />
Drunk fearless, and with him partook the bread<br />
That his pale lips most reverently had blessed,<br />
With words becoming such a holy man.<br />
<br />
His dwelling a recess in some rude rock,<br />
Books, beads, and Maple dish his meagre stock.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">&mdash;It seemed a hermit's cell,</span><br />
Yet void of hour-glass, skull, and Maple dish.<br />
</p>

<p>There is an American species of the Maple, <i>A.
saccharinum</i>, which yields a considerable quantity
of sap, from which the Canadians make sugar of
an average quality. The season for tapping the
trees is in February, March, and April. From a
pint to five gallons of syrup may be obtained from
one tree in a day; though, when a frosty night is
succeeded by a dry and brilliant day, the rush of
sap is much greater. The yearly product of sugar
from each tree is about three pounds. Trees which
grow in lone and moist places, afford a greater
quantity of sap than those which occupy rising
ground; but it is less rich in the saccharine principle.
That of insulated trees, left standing in
the middle of fields, or by the side of fences, is the
best. It is also remarked, that in districts which
have been cleared of other trees, and even of the
less vigorous sugar maples, the product of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
remainder is proportionally greater. The sap is
converted into sugar by boiling, till reduced to the
proper consistency for being poured into moulds.</p>

<p>There are now cultivated in England more
than twenty species of Maple, brought from every
quarter of the globe, several of which are likely to
prove hardy. They are among the most ornamental
trees of artificial plantations, on account
of the great beauty and variety of their foliage,
which changes to a fine scarlet, or rich yellow, in
autumn. The larger growing species are often
many years before they come to flower, and, after
they do so, they sometimes flower several years
before they mature seeds.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Mountain-Ash (<i>P. aucuparia</i>) is a native of
most parts of Europe, and western Asia. It is also
found in Japan, and in the most northern parts of
North America. In Britain it is common in woods
and hedges in mountainous, but rather moist situations,
in every part of the island, and also in
Ireland. It forms an erect-stemmed tree, with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
orbicular head. When fully grown, like every
other description of <i>Pyrus</i>, it assumes a somewhat
formal character, but in a young state its branches
are disposed in a more loose and graceful manner.
In the Scottish Highlands, according to Lauder,
"it becomes a considerable tree. There, on some
rocky mountain covered with dark pines and waving
birch, which cast a solemn gloom over the lake
below, a few Mountain-Ashes, joining in a clump,
and mixing with them, have a fine effect. In summer
the light green tint of their foliage, and in
autumn the glowing berries which hang clustering
upon them, contrast beautifully with the
deeper green of the pines; and if they are happily
blended, and not in too large a proportion, they
add some of the most picturesque furniture with
which the sides of those rugged mountains are
invested."</p>

<p>The stems of the Mountain-Ash are covered with
a smooth gray bark, and the branches, while young,
have a smooth purplish bark. The leaves are pinnate,
downy beneath, serrated; panicle corymbose,
with downy stalks; flowers numerous, white; fruit
globose, scarlet, acid, and austere. Flowers in
May and June.</p>

<span class="figcaption">Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit of <i>P. aucuparia</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The Mountain-Ash is almost always raised from
seed, which may be sown any time from November
to February. The tree grows rapidly for the first
three or four years, attaining, in five years, the
height of from eight to nine feet; after which it
begins to form a head, and, in ten years, will attain
the height of twenty feet. As it grows rapidly,
even in the most exposed situations, it forms an
admirable nurse-tree to the oak, and other slow-growing
species; the more so as it is incapable of
being drawn up by culture above a certain height,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
thereafter quietly submitting to be over-topped
and destroyed, by the shade and drip of those which
it was planted to shelter and protect. It is frequently
planted for coppice-wood, the shoots being
well adapted for poles, and for hoops, and the
bark being in demand by tanners. The wood is
fine-grained, hard, capable of being stained any
colour, and of taking a high polish. It is much
used for the husbandman's tools, goads, &amp;c., and
the wheelwright values it on account of its being
homogeneous, or all heart. If the tree be large and
fully grown, it will yield planks, boards, and timber.
Next to the yew it was useful for bows&mdash;a circumstance
we ought not to omit recording, if it
were only to perpetuate the celebrity of our once
English ancestors. It is named in a statute of
Henry VIII. as being serviceable for this purpose.
It makes excellent fuel; though Evelyn
says he never observed any use, except that the
blossoms are of an agreeable scent, and the berries
offer such temptation to the thrushes, that, as long
as they last, you may be sure of their company.
Ale and beer brewed with these berries, being ripe,
is esteemed an incomparable drink. In Wales,
this tree is reputed so sacred, that there is scarcely
a church-yard without one of them growing therein.
And formerly&mdash;and, we believe, in some parts
even now&mdash;on a certain day in the year many
persons religiously wore a cross made of the
wood.</p>

<p>Keats, in his early poems, notices the loftiness
of this tree, and its waving head:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">&mdash;He was withal</span><br />
A man of elegance and stature tall;<br />
So that the waving of his plumes would be<br />
High as the berries of a wild Ash-tree,<br />
Or the winged cap of Mercury.<br />
</p>

<p>In former days, when superstition prevailed, the
Mountain-Ash was considered an object of great
veneration. Often at this day a stump of it is
found in some old burying-place, or near the circle
of a Druid temple, whose rites it formerly invested
with its sacred shade. It was supposed to be, and
in some places still is esteemed to be, possessed of
the property of driving away witches and evil
spirits, and this property is recorded in one of the
stanzas of a very ancient song, called the <i>Laidley
Worm of Spindleston Heughs:</i></p>

<p class="poem">
Their spells were vain, the hags return'd<br />
To the queen, in sorrowful mood,<br />
Crying that witches have no pow'r<br />
Where there is roan-tree wood.<br />
</p>

<p>That the superstition respecting the virtues of
this tree does exist in Yorkshire at the present
day, we know, and of the truth of the following
anecdote, related by Waterton, the author of the
celebrated <i>Wanderings</i>, we have not the slightest
doubt; it is printed in one of his communications
to the <i>Magazine of Natural History</i>:&mdash;"In the
village of Walton," says Mr. Waterton, "I have
two small tenants; the name of one is James
Simpson, and that of the other Sally Holloway;
and Sally's stands a little before the house of
Simpson. Some three months ago I overtook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Simpson on the turnpike road, and I asked him if
his cow was getting better, for his son had told me
that she had fallen sick. 'She's coming on surprisingly,
Sir,' quoth he; 'the last time the cow-doctor
came to see her, "Jem," said he to me,
looking earnestly at Old Sally's house; "Jem,"
said he, "mind and keep your cowhouse door shut
before the sun goes down, otherwise I won't answer
for what may happen to the cow." "Ay, ay, my
lad," said I, "I understand your meaning; but I
am up to the old slut, and I defy her to do me any
harm now!"' 'And what has Old Sally been
doing to you, James?' said I. 'Why, Sir,' replied
he, 'we all know too well what she can do. She
has long owed me a grudge; and my cow, which
was in very good health, fell sick immediately after
Sally had been seen to look in at the door of the
cowhouse, just as night was coming on. The cow
grew worse, and so I went and cut a bit of wiggin
(Mountain-Ash), and I nailed the branches all up
and down the cowhouse; and, Sir, you may see
them there if you will take the trouble to step in.
I am a match for Old Sally now, and she can't do
me any more harm, so long as the wiggin branches
hang in the place where I have nailed them. My
poor cow will get better in spite of her.' Alas!
thought I to myself, as the deluded man was finishing
his story, how much there is yet to be done in
our own country by the schoolmaster of the nineteenth
century!"</p>

<p>The Mountain-Ash, so esteemed among our
northern neighbours as a protection against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
evil designs of wizards and witches, is propagated
by the Parisians for a very different purpose. It
is used as one of the principal charms for enticing
the French belles into the public gardens,
where they are permitted to use all the spells and
witcheries of which they are mistresses; and certainly
this tree, ornamented by its brilliant scarlet
fruit, has a most enchanting appearance when
lighted up with lamps, in the months of August
and September.</p>

<p>The varieties of the Mountain-Ash are:&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <i>P. fructu luteo</i>, with yellow berries. 3. <i>P. foliis variegatis</i>,
with variegated leaves. 4. <i>P. fastigiata</i>, with the branches
upright and rigid. 5. <i>P. pinnatifida</i>, with deeply pinnatified
leaves.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Black-fruited, or Common Mulberry, is generally
supposed to be a native of Persia, where there
are still masses of it found in a wild state. It was
first brought to England in 1548, when some trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
were planted at Sion, near London, one of which
still survives. About 1608 James I. recommended
by royal edict, and by letter in his own writing
to the lord-lieutenant of every county, the
planting of Mulberry-trees and the rearing of silk-worms,
which are fed upon the leaves; also offering
plants at three farthings each, and packets of
Mulberry seeds to all who would sow them. Although
the king failed to naturalize the production
of silk in this country, he rendered the tree so
fashionable, that there is scarcely an old garden
or gentleman's seat throughout the country, which
can be traced back to the seventeenth century, in
which a Mulberry-tree is not to be found. It was
at this time that Shakspeare planted the one in his
garden at Stratford-on-Avon, which was known as
"Shakspeare's Mulberry-Tree," until it was felled
in 1756; and that it was a black Mulberry we
learn from Mr. Drake, a native of Stratford, who
frequently in his youth ate of its fruit, some
branches of which hung over the wall which
bounded his father's garden.&mdash;Drake's <i>Shakspeare</i>,
vol. ii., p. 584.</p>

<p>In this country the Black-fruited Mulberry always
assumes something of a dwarf or stunted
character, spreading into thick arms or branches
near the ground, and forming a very large head.
The bark is rough and thick, and the leaves cordate,
unequally serrated, and very rough. The
fruit is large, of a dark purple, very wholesome,
and agreeable to the palate. This tree is remarkable
for the slowness of its growth, and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
being one of the last trees to develope its leaves,
though it is one of the first to ripen its fruit. It
is also wonderfully tenacious of life: "the roots
of one which had lain dormant in the ground for
twenty-four years, being said, after the expiration
of that time, to have sent up shoots."</p>

<p>The Black-fruited Mulberry will grow in almost
any soil or situation that is moderately dry, and in
any climate not much colder than that of London.
North of York it requires a wall, except in very
favourable situations. It is very easily propagated
by truncheons, or pieces of branches, eight or nine
feet in length, planted half their depth in tolerably
good soil, when they will bear fruit the following
year. It is now rarely propagated by seeds, which
seldom ripen in this country. No tree, perhaps,
receives more benefit from the spade and the dunghill
than the Mulberry; it ought, therefore, to be
frequently dug about the roots, and occasionally
assisted with manure. The fruit is very much
improved by the tree being trained as an espalier,
within the reflection of a south wall. As a standard
tree, whether for ornament or the production of
well-sized fruit, the Mulberry requires very little
pruning, or attention of any kind.</p>

<p>The Black-fruited Mulberry has been known
from the earliest records of antiquity; it is mentioned
four times in the Bible, 2 Sam. v. 23, 24;
1 Chron. xiv. 14, 15. It was dedicated by the
Greeks to Minerva, probably because it was considered
as the wisest of trees; and Jupiter the
Protector was called Mored. Ovid has celebrated
the Black Mulberry in the story of Pyramus and
Thisbe; in which he relates that its fruit was snow-white
until the commingled blood of the unfortunate
lovers, who killed themselves under its
shade, was absorbed by its roots, when</p>

<p class="poem">
Dark in the rising tide the berries grew,<br />
And white no longer, took a sable hue;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
But brighter crimson springing from the root,<br />
Shot through the black, and purpled all the fruit.<br />
</p>

<p>Cowley, in the fifth book of his poem on plants,
has given a very plain and accurate description of
the apparently cautious habits of this tree. He
also thus alludes to the above fable:</p>

<p class="poem">
But cautiously the Mulberry did move,<br />
And first the temper of the skies would prove;<br />
What sign the sun was in, and if she might<br />
Give credit yet to winter's seeming flight:<br />
She dares not venture on his first retreat,<br />
Nor trust her fruit or leaves to doubtful heat;<br />
Her ready sap within her bark confines,<br />
Till she of settled warmth has certain signs!<br />
Then, making rich amends for the delay,<br />
With sudden haste she dons her green array;<br />
In two short months her purple fruit appears,<br />
And of two lovers slain the tincture wears.<br />
Her fruit is rich, but she doth leaves produce<br />
Of far surpassing worth, and noble use.<br />
<span style="letter-spacing:1em;">* * * * *</span><br />
<span style="letter-spacing:1em;">* * *</span> They supply<br />
The ornaments of royal luxury:<br />
The beautiful they make more beauteous seem,<br />
The charming sex owe half their charms to them;<br />
To them effeminate men their vestments owe;<br />
How vain the pride which insect worms bestow!<br />
</p>

<p>Besides the Black-fruited Mulberry, there are
four other species sufficiently hardy to bear our
climate without protection; but it will be here
sufficient to give a short account of the White-fruited
(<i>M. alba</i>) as the next best known, and as
the species whose leaves are used in feeding silk-worms.
<i>M. alba</i>, is only found truly wild in the
Chinese province of Seres, or Serica. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
brought to Constantinople about the beginning of
the sixth century, and was introduced into England
in 1596, where it is still not very common. In the
south of Europe it is grown in plantations by itself,
like willows and fruit trees; also in hedge-rows, and
as hedges, as far north as Frankfort-on-the-Oder.
When allowed to arrive at maturity, this tree is
not less beautiful than the fairest elm, often reaching
thirty or forty feet in height. When cultivated
to furnish food for the silk-worms, the trees are
never allowed to grow higher than three or four feet
being cut down to the ground every year in the same
manner as a raspberry plantation. In France and
Italy the leaves are gathered only once a-year;
and when the trees are then wholly stripped, no
injury arises from the operation; but if any leaves
are left on the trees, they generally receive a severe
shock.</p>

<p>The specific characters of the White-fruited Mulberry
are&mdash;<i>Leaves</i> with a deep scallop at the base,
and either cordate or ovate, undivided or lobed,
serrated with unequal teeth, glossy or smoothish,
the projecting portions on the two sides of the basal
sinus unequal. The <i>fruit</i> is seldom good for human
food, but is excellent for poultry. It is a tree
of rapid growth, attaining the height of twenty feet
in five or six years, and plants cut down producing
shoots four or five feet long in one season.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">On</span> our entrance into the Woodland, the eye first
greets the majestic Oak, which is represented as
holding the same rank among the plants of the
temperate regions throughout the world, that the
lion does among quadrupeds, and the eagle among
birds; that is to say, it is the emblem of grandeur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
strength, and duration; of force that resists, as
the lion is of force that acts. In short, its bulk,
its longevity, and the extraordinary strength and
durability of its timber, constitute it the King of
Forest trees. These and other characteristics of
the Oak are graphically expressed by the Roman
poet:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">Jove's own tree,</span><br />
That holds the woods in awful sovereignty,<br />
Requires a depth of loading in the ground,<br />
And next the lower skies a bed profound;<br />
High as his topmast boughs to heaven ascend,<br />
So low his roots to hell's dominions tend.<br />
Therefore, nor winds, nor winter's rage o'erthrows<br />
His bulky body, but unmoved he grows.<br />
For length of ages lasts his happy reign,<br />
And lives of mortal men contend in vain.<br />
Full in the midst of his own strength he stands,<br />
Stretching his brawny arms and leafy hands;<br />
His shade protects the plains, his head the hills commands.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;"><i>Virgil's Georgics</i>, II.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"The Oak grows naturally in the middle and
south of Europe; in the north of Africa; and, in
Asia, in Natolia, the Himalayas, Cochin-China,
and Japan, In America it abounds throughout
the greater part of the northern continent, more
especially in the United States. In Europe, the
Oak has been, and is, more particularly abundant
in Britain, France, Spain, and Italy. In Britain
two species only are indigenous; in France there
are four or five sorts; and in Spain, Italy, and
Greece, six or seven sorts. The number of sorts
described by botanists as species, and as natives of
Europe, exceed 30; and as natives of North America,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
40. The latter are all comprised between 20°
and 48° N. lat. In Europe, Asia, and Africa, Oaks
are found from 60° to 18° N. lat., and even in the
Torrid Zone, in situations rendered temperate by
their elevation."</p>

<p>In Britain, the Oak is everywhere indigenous,
the two species being generally found growing together
in a wild state. It, however, requires a soil
more or less alluvial or loamy to attain its full size,
and to bring its timber to perfection; these being
seldom attained in the Highlands of Scotland, where
it is still abundant in an indigenous state. The two
species, <i>Q. robur</i>, or <i>pedunculata</i>, and <i>Q. sessiliflora</i>,
are readily distinguished from each other by
the first having the leaves on short stalks, and the
acorns on long stalks, the other by the leaves being
long-stalked, and the acorns short-stalked. In
full-grown trees of the two species there is little or
no difference either in magnitude and general appearance,
or in quality of timber. <i>Q. robur</i> being
the most abundant, is called the Common Oak.
Its twigs are smooth and grayish-brown: leaves
deciduous, sessile, of a thin texture, obovate-oblong,
serrated, with the lobes entire, and nearly blunt,
diminishing towards the base; a little blistered,
and scarcely glossy, with some down occasionally
on the under side: acorns oblong, obtuse, much
longer than the hemispherical scaly cup, placed on
long peduncles. The distinguishing characters or
the less common species, <i>Q. sessiliflora</i>, the sessile-fruited
oak, are, leaves on longish foot-stalks,
deciduous, smooth, and oblong, the sinuses opposite,
and rather acute, the fruit sessile, oblong. In
other respects it so closely resembles the other
species, that of the numerous trees recorded for
their enormous dimensions, age, and other peculiarities,
the species is seldom particularized.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Loudon believed that no important or constant
difference exists between the mode of growth of the
two kinds, individuals of both being found equally
pyramidal, fastigiate, or orbicular. He considered,
however, that <i>Q. sessiliflora</i> could "readily be distinguished
even at a distance, by the less tufted
appearance, and generally palish green of its
foliage in summer, and in winter by its less tortuous
spray and branches, by its light coloured
bark, by its large buds, and by its frequently retaining
its leaves after they had withered, till the
following spring."</p>

<p>The Oak, says Mr. Gilpin, is confessedly the most
picturesque tree in itself, and the most accommodating
in composition. It refuses no subject, either
in natural or artificial landscape; it is suited to the
grandest, and may with propriety be introduced
into the most pastoral. It adds new dignity to the
ruined tower and Gothic arch; it throws its arms
with propriety over the mantling pool, and may be
happily introduced into the humblest scene.</p>

<p class="poem">
Imperial Oak, a cottage in thy shade<br />
Finds safety, or a monarch in thy arms:<br />
Respectful generations see thee spread,<br />
Careless of centuries, even in decay<br />
Majestic: thy far-shadowing boughs contend<br />
With time: the obsequious winds shall visit thee,<br />
To scatter round the children of thy age,<br />
And eternize thy latest benefits.<br />
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 15em;">W. Tighe.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">The longevity of the Oak is supposed to extend
beyond that of any other tree. It is through age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that the Oak acquires its greatest beauty, which
often continues increasing, even into decay, if
any proportion exists between the stem and the
branches. When the branches rot away, and the
trunk is left alone, the tree is in its decrepitude,
the last stage of life, and all the beauty is gone.</p>

<p>Spenser has given us a good picture of an Oak
just verging towards its last stage of decay:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">&mdash;A huge Oak, dry and dead,</span><br />
Still clad with reliques of its trophies old,<br />
Lifting to heaven its aged, hoary head,<br />
Whose foot on earth hath got but feeble hold,<br />
And, half disbowelled, stands above the ground<br />
With wreathed roots, and naked arms,<br />
And trunk all rotten and unsound.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">He also compares a gray-headed old man to an aged
Oak-tree, covered with frost:</p>

<p class="poem">
There they do find that goodly aged sire,<br />
With snowy locks adown his shoulders shed;<br />
As hoary frost with spangles doth attire<br />
The mossy branches of an Oak half dead.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Montgomery, too, does not forget to observe the
longevity of the sturdy Oak:</p>

<p class="poem">
As some triumphal Oak, whose boughs have spread<br />
Their changing foliage through a thousand years,<br />
Bows to the rushing wind its glorious head.<br />
</p>

<p>As we before noted, the beauty of almost every
species of tree increases after its prime; but unless
it hath the good fortune to stand in some place of
difficult access, or under the protection of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
patron whose mansion it adorns, we rarely see it in
that grandeur and dignity which it would acquire
by age. Some of the noblest Oaks in England
were, at least formerly, found in Sussex. They required
sometimes a score of oxen to draw them,
and were carried on a sort of wain, which in that
deep country is expressly called a <i>tugg</i>. It was not
uncommon for it to spend two or three years in
performing its journey to the Royal dock-yard at
Chatham. One tugg carried the load only a little
way, and left it for another tugg to take up. If
the rains set in, it stirred no more that year; and
frequently no part of the next summer was dry
enough for the tugg to proceed: so that the timber
was generally pretty well seasoned before it arrived
at its destination.</p>

<p>In this fallen state alone, it is true, the tree becomes
the basis of England's glory, though we regret
its fall. Therefore, we must not repine, but
address the children of the wood as the gallant
Oak, on his removal from the forest, is said to have
addressed the scion by his side:</p>

<p class="poem">
Where thy great grandsire spread his awful shade,<br />
A holy Druid mystic circles made;<br />
Myself a sapling when thy grandsire bore<br />
Intrepid Edward to the Gallic shore.<br />
Me, now my country calls: adieu, my son!<br />
And, as the circling years in order run,<br />
May'st thou renew the forest's boast and pride,<br />
Victorious in some future contest ride.<br />
</p>

<p>We are sure that all who can appreciate beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
poetry will be gratified by the following pathetic
lamentation of the elegant Vanier:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">&mdash;No greater beauty can adorn</span><br />
The hamlet, than a grove of ancient Oak.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! how unlike their sires of elder times<br />
The sons of Gallia now! They, in each tree<br />
Dreading some unknown power, dared not to lift<br />
An axe. Though scant of soil, they rather sought<br />
For distant herbage, than molest their groves.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all is spoil and violence. Where now<br />
Exists an Oak, whose venerable stem<br />
Has seen three centuries? unless some steep,<br />
To human footstep inaccessible,<br />
Defend a favour'd plant. Now, if some sire<br />
Leave to his heir a forest scene, that heir,<br />
With graceless hands, hews down each awful trunk,<br />
Worthy of Druid reverence. There he rears<br />
A paltry copse, destined, each twentieth year,<br />
To blaze inglorious on the hearth. Hence woods,<br />
Which shelter'd once the stag and grisly boar,<br />
Scarce to the timorous hare sure refuge lend.<br />
Farewell each rural virtue, with the love<br />
Of rural scenes! Sage Contemplation wings<br />
Her flight; no more from burning suns she seeks<br />
A cool retreat. No more the poet sings,<br />
Amid re-echoing groves, his moral lay.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">As it is thus a general complaint that noble trees
are rarely to be found, we must seek them where
we can, and consider them, when found, as matters
of curiosity, and pay them a due respect. And
yet, we should suppose, they are not so frequently
found here in a state of nature as in more uncultivated
countries. In the forests of America,
and other scenes, they have filled the plains from
the beginning of time; and where they grow so
close, and cover the ground with so impervious a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
shade that even a weed can scarce rise beneath
them, the single tree is lost. Unless it stand on
the outskirt of the wood, it is circumscribed, and
has not room to expand its vast limbs as nature
directs. When we wish, therefore, to find the most
sublime sylvan character, the Oak, the elm, or the
ash, in perfection, we must not look for it in close,
thick woods, but standing single, independent of all
connections, as we sometimes find it in our own
forests, though oftener in better protected places,
shooting its head wildly into the clouds, spreading
its arms towards every wind of heaven:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 13.5em;">&mdash;The Oak</span><br />
Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm.<br />
He seems indignant, and to feel<br />
The impression of the blast with proud disdain;<br />
But, deeply earth'd, the unconscious monarch owes<br />
His firm stability to what he scorns:<br />
More fix'd below, the more disturb'd above.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Again, we are told that the foliage of the Oak is</p>

<p class="poem">
Tenacious of the stem, and firm against the wind.<br />
</p>

<p>The shade of the Oak-tree has been a favourite
theme with British poets. Thomson, speaking of
Hagley Park, the seat of his friend Littleton, calls
it the British Tempe, and describes him as courting
the muse beneath the shade of solemn Oaks:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">&mdash;There, along the dale</span><br />
With woods o'erhung, and shagged with mossy rocks,<br />
Whence on each hand the gushing waters play,<br />
And down the rough cascade white dashing fall,<br />
Or gleam in lengthened vista through the trees,<br />
You silent steal; or sit beneath the shade<br />
Of solemn Oaks, that tuft the swelling mounts,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Thrown graceful round by Nature's careless hand,<br />
And pensive listens to the various voice<br />
Of rural peace: the herds, the flocks, the birds,<br />
The hollow whispering breeze, the plaint of rills,<br />
That, purling down amid the twisted roots<br />
Which creep around, their dewy murmurs shake<br />
On the soothed ear.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Wordsworth also mentions the fine broad shade of
the spreading Oak:</p>

<p class="poem">
Beneath that large old Oak, which near their door<br />
Stood, and, from its enormous breadth of shade,<br />
Chosen for the shearer's covert from the sun,<br />
Thence, in our rustic dialect, was called<br />
The clipping tree: a name which yet it bears.<br />
</p>

<p>The Oaks of Chaucer are particularly celebrated,
as the trees under which</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&mdash;The laughing sage</span><br />
Caroll'd his moral song.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">They grew in the park at Donnington Castle, near
Newbury, where Chaucer spent his latter life in
studious retirement. The largest of these trees
was the King's Oak, and carried an erect stem of
fifty feet before it broke into branches, and was cut
into a beam five feet square. The next in size was
called the Queen's Oak, and survived the calamities
of the civil wars in King Charles's time, though
Donnington Castle and the country around it were
so often the scenes of action and desolation. Its
branches were very curious: they pushed out from
the stem in several uncommon directions, imitating
the horns of a ram, rather than the branches of an
Oak. When it was felled, it yielded a beam forty
feet long, without knot or blemish, perfectly straight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
four feet square at the butt end, and near a yard
at the top. The third of these Oaks was called
Chaucer's, of which we have no particulars; in
general only we are told, that it was a noble tree,
though inferior to either of the others. Not one
of them, we should suppose, from this account, to
be a tree of picturesque beauty. A straight stem,
of forty or fifty feet, let its head be what it will,
can hardly produce a picturesque form.</p>

<p>Close by the gate of the water-walk at Magdalen
College, Oxford, grew an Oak, which, perhaps,
stood there a sapling when Alfred the Great
founded the University. This period only includes
a space of nine hundred years, which is no great
age for an Oak. It is a difficult matter indeed, to
ascertain the age of a tree. The age of a castle,
or abbey, is an object of history: even a common
house is recorded by the family that built it. All
these objects arrive at maturity in their youth, if
we may so speak; but the tree, gradually completing
its growth, is not worth recording in the
early part of its existence. It is then only a common
tree; and afterwards, when it becomes remarkable
for its age, all memory of its youth is lost.
This tree, however, can almost produce historical evidence
for the age assigned to it. About five hundred
years after the time of Alfred, William of
Wainfleet, Dr. Stukely tells us, expressly ordered
his college to be founded near the Great Oak; and
an Oak could not, we think, be less than five hundred
years of age to merit that title, together with
the honour of fixing the site of a college. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the magnificence of Cardinal Wolsey erected that
handsome tower which is so ornamental to the
whole building, this tree might probably be in the
meridian of its glory, or rather, perhaps, it had
attained a green old age. But it must have been
manifestly in its decline at that memorable period
when the tyranny of James gave the Fellows of
Magdalen so noble an opportunity of withstanding
bigotry and superstition. It was afterwards
much injured in Charles II.'s time, when the
present walks were laid out. The roots were disturbed,
and from that period it rapidly declined, and
became reduced by degrees to little more than a
mere trunk. The faithful records of history have
handed down its ancient dimensions. Through a
space of sixteen yards on every side from its trunk,
it once flung its boughs; and then its magnificent
pavilion could have sheltered with ease three thousand
men; though, in its decayed state, it could
for many years do little more than shelter some
luckless individual, whom the drenching shower
had overtaken in his evening walk. In the summer
of the year 1788, this magnificent ruin fell to
the ground, alarming the College with its rushing
sound. It then appeared how precariously it had
stood for many years. Its grand tap-root was decayed,
and it had hold of the earth only by two or
three roots, of which none was more than a couple
of inches in diameter. From a part of its ruin a
chair has been made for the President of the College,
which will long continue its memory.</p>

<p>Near Worksop grew an Oak, which, in respect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
both to its own dignity and the dignity of its situation,
deserves honourable mention. In point of
grandeur, few trees equalled it. It overspread a
space of ninety feet from the extremities of its
opposite boughs. These dimensions will produce
an area capable, on mathematical calculation, of
covering a squadron of two hundred and thirty-five
horse. The dignity of its station was equal to the
dignity of the tree itself. It stood on a point where
Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, and Derbyshire unite,
and spread its shade over a portion of each. From
the honourable station of thus fixing the boundaries
of three large counties, it was equally respected
through the domains of them all, and was known
far and wide by the honourable distinction of the
Shire-Oak, by which appellation it was marked
among cities, towns, and rivers, in all the larger
maps of England.</p>

<p>Gilpin gives us a singular account of an Oak-tree
that formerly stood in the New Forest, Hampshire,
against which, according to tradition, the
arrow of Sir Walter Tyrrell glanced which killed
William Rufus. According to Leland, and Camden
from him, this tree stood at a place called
Througham, where a chapel was erected to the
king's memory. But there is now not any place of
that name in the New Forest, nor the remains or
remembrance of any chapel. It is, however, conjectured
that Througham might be what is at present
called Fritham, where the tradition of the
country seems to have fixed the spot with more
credibility than the tree. It is probable that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
chapel was only some little temporary oratory,
which, having never been endowed, might very
soon fall into decay: but the tree, we may suppose,
would be noticed at the time by everybody who
lived near it, and by strangers who came to see it;
and it is as likely that it never could be forgotten
afterwards. Those who regard a tree as an insufficient
record of an event so many centuries
back, may be reminded that seven hundred years
(and it is little more than that since the death of
Rufus) is no extraordinary period in the existence
of an Oak. About one hundred years ago, however,
this tree had become so decayed and mutilated,
that it is probable the spot would have been completely
forgotten if some other memorial had not
been raised. Before the stump, therefore, was
eradicated, Lord Delaware, who occupied one of the
neighbouring lodges, caused a triangular stone to
be erected, on the three sides of which the following
inscriptions are engraved:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">I.</p>

<p>Here stood the Oak-tree, on which an arrow, shot by Sir
Walter Tyrrel at a stag, glanced, and struck King William II.,
surnamed Rufus, in the breast, of which stroke he instantly
died, on the 2d of August, 1100.</p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>King William II., being thus slain, was laid on a cart belonging
to one Purkess, and drawn from hence to Winchester, and
buried in the Cathedral Church of that city.</p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

<p>That the spot where an event so memorable happened, might
not hereafter be unknown, this stone was set up by John Lord
Delaware, who has seen the tree growing in this place.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">Lord Delaware here asserts plainly that he had
seen the Oak-tree; and as he resided much near
the place, there is reason to believe that he had
other grounds for the assertion besides the mere
tradition of the country. That matter, however,
rests on his authority.</p>

<p>Gilpin likewise gives us the following account of
the Cadenham Oak, in the New Forest, which was
remarkable for putting forth its buds in the depth
of winter. Cadenham is a village about three miles
from Lyndhurst, on the road to Salisbury:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having often heard of this Oak, I took a ride
to see it on December 29, 1781. It was pointed
out to me among several other Oaks, surrounded
by a little forest stream, winding round a knoll on
which they stood. It is a tall straight plant, of no
great age, and apparently vigorous, except that its
top has been injured, from which several branches
issue in the form of pollard shoots. It was entirely
bare of leaves, as far as I could discern, when I saw
it, and undistinguishable from the other Oaks in its
neighbourhood, except that its bark seemed rather
smoother, occasioned, I apprehended, only by frequent
climbing.</p>

<p>"Having had the account of its early budding
confirmed on the spot, I engaged one Michael
Lawrence, who kept the White Hart, a small alehouse
in the neighbourhood, to send me some of
the leaves to Vicar's Hill, as soon as they should
appear. The man, who had not the least doubt
about the matter, kept his word, and sent me several
twigs on the morning of January 5, 1782, a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
hours after they had been gathered. The leaves
were fairly expanded, and about an inch in length.
From some of the buds two leaves had unsheathed
themselves, but in general only one.</p>

<p>"Through what power in nature this strange
premature vegetation is occasioned, I believe no
naturalist can explain. I sent some of the leaves
to one of the ablest botanists we have, Mr. Lightfoot,
author of the <i>Flora Scotica</i>, and was in hopes
of hearing something satisfactory on the subject.
But he is one of those philosophers who are not
ashamed of ignorance where attempts at knowledge
are mere conjecture. He assured me he neither
could account for it in any way, nor did he know
of any other instance of premature vegetation,
except the Glastonbury thorn. The philosophers
of the forest, in the meantime, account for the
thing at once, through the influence of old Christmas
day, universally believing that the Oak buds
on that day, and that only. The same opinion
is held with regard to the Glastonbury thorn,
by the common people of the west of England.
But, without doubt, the vegetation there is gradual,
and forwarded or retarded by the mildness
or severity of the weather. One of its progeny,
which grew in the gardens of the Duchess
Dowager of Portland, at Bulstrode, had its flower-buds
perfectly formed so early as December 21,
1781, which is fifteen days earlier than it ought to
flower, according to the vulgar prejudice.</p>

<p>"This early spring, however, of the Cadenham
Oak, is of very short duration. The buds, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
unfolding themselves, make no farther progress, but
immediately shrink from the season and die. The
tree continues torpid, like other deciduous trees,
during the remainder of the winter, and vegetates
again in the spring, at the usual season. I have
seen it in full leaf in the middle of summer, when
it appeared, both in its form and foliage, exactly
like other Oaks.</p>

<p>"I have been informed that another tree, with
the same property of early vegetation, has lately
been found near the spot where Rufus's monument
stands. If this be the case, it seems in some degree
to authenticate the account which Camden
gives us of the scene of that prince's death; for he
speaks of the premature vegetation of that very tree
on which the arrow of Tyrrel glanced, and the tree
I now speak of, if it really exist, though I have no
sufficient authority for it, might have been a descendant
of the old Oak, and hence inherited its
virtues.</p>

<p class="pmb2">"It is very probable, however, there may be
other Oaks in the forest which may likewise have
the property of early vegetation. I have heard
it often suspected, that people gather buds from
other trees and carry them, on old Christmas day,
to the Oak at Cadenham, from whence they pretend
to pluck them; for that tree is in such
repute, and resorted to annually by so many visitants,
that I think it could not easily supply all its
votaries without some foreign contributions. Some
have accounted for this phenomenon by supposing
that leaves have been preserved over the year by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
being steeped in vinegar. But I am well satisfied
this is not the case. Mr. Lightfoot, to whom I
sent the leaves, had no such suspicion."</p>

<p>In the <i>Salisbury Journal</i>, January 10, 1781, the
following paragraph appeared:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In consequence of a report that has prevailed
in this country for upwards of two centuries, and
which by many has been almost considered as a
matter of faith, that the Oak at Cadenham, in the
New Forest, shoots forth leaves on every old Christmas
day, and that no leaf is ever to be seen on it,
either before or after that day, during the winter;
a lady, who is now on a visit in this city, and who
is attentively curious in every thing relative to art
or nature, made a journey to Cadenham on Monday,
the 3d instant, purposely to inquire, on the
spot, about the production of this famous tree. On
her arrival near it, the usual guide was ready to
attend her; but on his being desired to climb the
Oak, and to search whether there were any leaves
then on it, he said it would be to no purpose, but
that if she would come on the Wednesday following
(Christmas day), she might certainly see thousands.
However, he was prevailed on to ascend,
and on the first branch which he gathered appeared
several fair new leaves, fresh sprouted from the
buds, and nearly an inch and a half in length. It
may be imagined that the guide was more amazed
at this premature production than the lady; for so
strong was his belief in the truth of the whole
tradition, that he would have pledged his life that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
not a leaf was to have been discovered on any part
of the tree before the usual hour.</p>

<p>"But though the superstitious part of this ancient
legend is hence confuted, yet it must be allowed
there is something very uncommon and
curious in an Oak constantly shooting forth leaves
at this unseasonable time of the year, and that the
cause of it well deserves the philosophical attention
of the botanist. In some years there is no doubt
that this Oak may show its first leaves on the
Christmas morning, as probably as on a few days
before; and this perhaps was the case in the last
year, when a gentleman of this neighbourhood, a
nice and critical observer, strictly examined the
branches, not only on the Christmas morn, but
also on the day prior to it. On the first day not
a leaf was to be found, but on the following every
branch had its complement, though they were then
but just shooting from the buds, none of them
being more than a quarter of an inch long. The
latter part of the story may easily be credited&mdash;that
no leaves are to be seen on it after Christmas
day&mdash;as large parties yearly assemble about the
Oak on that morning, and regularly strip every
appearance of a leaf from it."</p>

<p>At Elderslie, near Paisley, upon a little knoll,
there stood, near the end of the last century, the
ruins of an Oak, which was supposed to be the
largest tree that ever grew in Scotland. The
trunk was then wholly decayed and hollow, but it
was evident, from what remained, that its diameter
could not have been less than eleven or twelve feet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
As to its age, we can only conjecture, from some
circumstances, that it is most likely a tree of great
antiquity. The little knoll whereon it stands is
surrounded by a swamp, over which a causeway
leads to the tree, or rather to a circle which seems
to have run round it. The vestiges of this circle,
as well as the causeway, bear a plain resemblance
to those works which are commonly attributed to
the Druids, so that this tree was probably a scene
of worship consecrated by these heathen priests.
But the credit of it does not depend on the dubious
vestiges of Druid antiquity. In a latter scene
of greater importance (if tradition ever be the
vehicle of truth) it bore a large share. When the
illustrious and renowned hero, William Wallace,
roused the spirit of the Scotch nation to oppose the
tyranny of Edward, he frequently chose the solitude
of Torwood as a place of rendezvous for his
army. There he concealed his numbers and his
designs, sallying out suddenly on the enemy's garrisons,
and retreating as suddenly when he feared
to be overpowered. While his army lay in those
woods, the Oak which we are now commemorating
was commonly his head-quarters. There the hero
generally slept, its hollow trunk being sufficiently
capacious, not only to afford shelter to himself, but
also to many of his followers. This tree has ever
since been known by the name of Wallace tree.</p>

<p>In the enclosure known as the Little Park, in
Windsor Forest, there is still standing the supposed
Oak immortalized by Shakspeare as the
scene of Hern the hunter's exploits:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&mdash;An old tale goes, that Hern the hunter,</span><br />
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest,<br />
Doth all the winter time, at still of midnight,<br />
Walk round about this Oak, with ragged horns;<br />
And then he blasts the trees, destroys the cattle,<br />
Makes the milch cow yield blood, and shakes a chain<br />
In hideous, dreadful manner.<br />

<p>This tree measures about twenty-four feet in circumference,
and is yet vigorous, which somewhat
injures its historical credit. For though it is evidently
a tree advanced in years, and might well
have existed in the time of Elizabeth, it seems too
strong and vigorous to have been a proper tree, in
that age, for Hern the hunter to have danced round.
Fairies, elves, and that generation of people, are
universally supposed to select the most ancient and
venerable trees to gambol under; and the poet
who should describe them dancing under a sapling,
would show very little acquaintance with his subject.
That this tree could not be called a venerable
tree two centuries ago is evident, because it
can scarcely assume that character even now. And
yet an Oak, in a soil it likes, will continue so many
years in a vigorous state, that we must not lay
more stress on this argument than it will fairly
bear. It may be added, however, in its favour,
that a pit, or ditch, is still shown near the tree, as
Shakspeare describes it, which may have been
preserved with the same veneration as the tree
itself.</p>

<p>There is an Oak in the grounds of Sir Gerrard
Van Neck, at Heveningham, in Suffolk, which carries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
us likewise into the times of Elizabeth. But
this tree brings its evidence with it&mdash;evidence
which, if necessary, might carry it into the Saxon
times. It is now falling fast into the decline of
years, and every year robs it more of its honours.
But its trunk, which is thirty-five feet in circumference,
still retains its grandeur, though the ornaments
of its boughs and foliage are much
reduced. But the grandeur of the trunk consists
only in appearance; it is a mere shell. In Queen
Elizabeth's time it was hollow, and from this circumstance
the tree derives the honour of being
handed down to posterity. That princess, who
from her earliest years loved masculine amusements,
used often, it is said, in her youth, to take
her stand in this tree and shoot the deer as they
passed. From that time it has been known by the
name of Queen Elizabeth's Oak.</p>

<p>The Swilcar Oak, in the Forest of Needwood, in
Staffordshire, was measured about 1771, and found
to be nineteen feet in girth at six feet from the
ground; and when measured in 1825 it was twenty-one
feet four inches and a half in circumference at
the same height from the ground. This proves
that the tree is slowly increasing, having gained
two feet four inches in fifty-four years, and yet it
is known, by historical documents, to be six hundred
years old. Though in decay it is still a fine,
shapely, characteristic tree. It stands in an open
lawn, surrounded by extensive woods. In a poem
entitled <i>Needwood Forest</i> the author thus addresses
it:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p class="poem">
Hail! stately Oak, whose wrinkled trunk hath stood,<br />
Age after age, the sovereign of the wood:<br />
You, who have seen a thousand springs unfold<br />
Their ravelled buds, and dip their flowers in gold&mdash;<br />
Ten thousand times yon moon relight her horn,<br />
And that bright eye of evening gild the morn,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, stately Oak, thy leaf-wrapped head sublime<br />
Ere long must perish in the wrecks of time;<br />
Should, o'er thy brow, the thunders harmless break,<br />
And thy firm roots in vain the whirlwinds shake,<br />
Yet must thou fall. Thy withering glories sunk,<br />
Arm after arm shall leave thy mouldering trunk.<br />
</p>

<p>The Cowthorpe, or Coltsthorpe Oak, near Wetherby,
in Yorkshire, had its principal branch rent
off by a storm in the year 1718, when it was accurately
measured, and found to contain more than
five tons of timber. Previous to this mutilation,
its branches are said to have extended over half an
acre of ground. At three feet from the ground,
this most gigantic of all trees is sixteen yards, or
forty-eight feet, and close to the root it is twenty-six
yards, or seventy-eight feet, in girth! Its
principal limb projects forty-eight feet from the
trunk. It is still in wonderful preservation, though
its foliage is thin. It has been called the King of
the British Sylva, and, indeed, it deserves the title,
and proud we may be of such a king.</p>

<p>There were two trees in Yardley Forest, called
Gog and Magog, which demand our notice on account
of one of them having been celebrated by the
muse of Cowper. The scenery in which they stood
is hallowed by his shade. He was fond of indulging
his melancholy minstrel musings among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
woodland scenery there. Gog, the larger of these
two Oaks, measured thirty-eight feet round at the
roots, and was twenty-eight feet in circumference
at three feet from the ground. It was fifty-eight
feet high, and contained one thousand six hundred
and sixty-eight feet seven inches of solid timber.
Magog was only forty-nine feet in height; but its
circumference was fifty-four feet four inches at the
ground, and thirty-one feet three at three feet high.
These two trees were near each other, and although
a good deal bared at the top by age, they were
very picturesque. We shall quote here the whole
of Cowper's Address to the "Yardley Oak"; from
which it would appear that only one of them then
remained:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Survivor sole, and hardly such, of all<br />
That once lived here, thy brethren, at my birth<br />
(Since which I number threescore winters pass'd)<br />
A shatter'd veteran, hollow-trunk'd perhaps,<br />
As now, and with excoriate forks deform,<br />
Relics of ages! Could a mind, imbued<br />
With truth from Heaven, created thing adore,<br />
I might with reverence kneel, and worship thee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It seems idolatry with some excuse,</span><br />
When our forefather Druids in their Oaks<br />
Imagined sanctity. The conscience, yet<br />
Unpurified by an authentic act<br />
Of amnesty, the meed of blood Divine,<br />
Loved not the light; but, gloomy, into gloom<br />
Of thickest shades, like Adam after taste<br />
Of fruit proscribed, as to a refuge, fled.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou wast a bauble once; a cup and ball,</span><br />
Which babes might play with; and the thievish jay,<br />
Seeking her food, with ease might have purloin'd<br />
The auburn nut that held thee, swallowing down<br />
Thy yet close-folded latitude of boughs,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
And all thine embryo vastness at a gulp.<br />
But Fate thy growth decreed; autumnal rains<br />
Beneath thy parent tree mellow'd the soil<br />
Design'd thy cradle; and a skipping deer,<br />
With pointed hoof dibbling the glebe, prepared<br />
The soft receptacle, in which, secure,<br />
Thy rudiments should sleep the winter through.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So Fancy dreams. Disprove it, if ye can,</span><br />
Ye reasoners broad awake, whose busy search<br />
Of argument, employ'd too oft amiss,<br />
Sifts half the pleasure of sweet life away I<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou fell'st mature; and in the loamy clod,</span><br />
Swelling with vegetative force instinct,<br />
Didst burst thine egg, as theirs the fabled Twins,<br />
Now stars; two lobes, protruding, pair'd exact;<br />
A leaf succeeded, and another leaf;<br />
And, all the elements thy puny growth<br />
Fostering propitious, thou becamest a twig.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who lived, when thou wast such? O, couldst thou speak,</span><br />
As in Dodona once thy kindred trees<br />
Oracular, I would not curious ask<br />
The future, best unknown, but at thy mouth<br />
Inquisitive, the less ambiguous past.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By thee I might correct, erroneous oft,</span><br />
The clock of history, facts and events<br />
Timing more punctual, unrecorded facts<br />
Recovering, and misstated setting right&mdash;<br />
Desperate attempt, till trees shall speak again!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Time made thee what thou wast, king of the woods;</span><br />
And Time hath made thee what thou art&mdash;a cave<br />
For owls to roost in. Once thy spreading boughs<br />
O'erhung the champaign; and the numerous flocks<br />
That grazed it, stood beneath that ample cope<br />
Uncrowded, yet safe-sheltered from the storm.<br />
No flock frequents thee now. Thou hast outlived<br />
Thy popularity, and art become<br />
(Unless verse rescue thee awhile) a thing<br />
Forgotten, as the foliage of thy youth.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While thus through all the stages thou hast push'd</span><br />
Of treeship&mdash;first a seedling hid in grass;<br />
Then twig; then sapling; and, as century roll'd<br />
Slow after century, a giant bulk<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Of girth enormous, with moss-cushioned root<br />
Upheaved above the soil, and sides emboss'd<br />
With prominent wens globose&mdash;till at the last<br />
The rottenness, which time is charged to inflict<br />
On other mighty ones, found also thee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What exhibitions various hath the world</span><br />
Witness'd of mutability in all<br />
That we account most durable below!<br />
Change is the diet on which all subsist,<br />
Created changeable, and change at last<br />
Destroys them. Skies uncertain now the heat<br />
Transmitting cloudless, and the solar beam<br />
Now quenching in a boundless sea of clouds&mdash;<br />
Calm and alternate storm, moisture and drought,<br />
Invigorate by turns the springs of life<br />
In all that live&mdash;plant, animal, and man&mdash;<br />
And in conclusion mar them. Nature's threads,<br />
Fine passing thought, ev'n in her coarsest works,<br />
Delight in agitation, yet sustain<br />
The force that agitates, not unimpaired;<br />
But, worn by frequent impulse, to the cause<br />
Of their best tone their dissolution owe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thought cannot spend itself, comparing still</span><br />
The great and little of thy lot, thy growth<br />
From almost nullity into a state<br />
Of matchless grandeur, and declension thence,<br />
Slow, into such magnificent decay.<br />
Time was, when, settling on thy leaf, a fly<br />
Could shake thee to the root&mdash;and time has been<br />
When tempests could not. At thy firmest age<br />
Thou hadst within thy bole solid contents,<br />
That might have ribb'd the sides and plank'd the deck<br />
Of some flagg'd admiral; and tortuous arms,<br />
The shipwright's darling treasure, didst present<br />
To the four-quarter'd winds, robust and bold,<br />
Warp'd into tough knee-timber,<a name="FNanchor_1_16" id="FNanchor_1_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_16" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> many a load!<br />
But the axe spared thee. In those thriftier days<br />
Oaks fell not, hewn by thousands, to supply<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
The bottomless demands of contest, waged<br />
For senatorial honours. Thus to Time<br />
The task was left to whittle thee away<br />
With his sly scythe, whose ever-nibbling edge,<br />
Noiseless, an atom, and an atom more,<br />
Disjoining from the rest, has, unobserved,<br />
Achieved a labour, which had far and wide,<br />
By man perform'd, made all the forest ring.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Embowell'd now, and of thy ancient self</span><br />
Possessing naught but the scoop'd rind, that seems<br />
A huge throat, calling to the clouds for drink,<br />
Which it would give in rivulets to thy root&mdash;<br />
Thou temptest none, but rather much forbidst<br />
The feller's toil, which thou couldst ill requite.<br />
Yet is thy root sincere, sound as the rock,<br />
A quarry of stout spurs and knotted fangs,<br />
Which, crook'd into a thousand whimsies, clasp<br />
The stubborn soil, and hold thee still erect.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So stands a kingdom, whose foundation yet</span><br />
Fails not, in virtue and in wisdom laid;<br />
Though all the superstructure, by the tooth<br />
Pulverised of venality, a shell<br />
Stands now, and semblance only of itself!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thine arms have left thee. Winds have rent them off</span><br />
Long since, and rovers of the forest wild<br />
With bow and shaft have burn'd them. Some have left<br />
A splinter'd stump, bleach'd to a snowy white;<br />
And some, memorial none where once they grew.<br />
Tet life still lingers in thee, and puts forth<br />
Proof not contemptible of what she can,<br />
Even where death predominates. The spring<br />
Finds thee not less alive to her sweet force,<br />
Than yonder upstarts of the neighbouring wood,<br />
So much thy juniors, who their birth received<br />
Half a millennium since the date of thine.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But since, although well qualified by age</span><br />
To teach, no spirit dwells in thee, nor voice<br />
May be expected from thee, seated here<br />
On thy distorted root, with hearers none,<br />
Or prompter, save the scene&mdash;I will perform,<br />
Myself the oracle, and will discourse<br />
In my own ear such matter as I may.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One man alone, the father of us all,</span><br />
Drew not his life from woman; never gazed,<br />
With mute unconsciousness of what he saw,<br />
On all around him; learn'd not by degrees,<br />
Nor owed articulation to his ear;<br />
But, moulded by his Maker into man<br />
At once, upstood intelligent, survey'd<br />
All creatures, with precision understood<br />
Their purport, uses, properties, assign'd<br />
To each his name significant, and, fill'd<br />
With love and wisdom, render'd back to Heaven,<br />
In praise harmonious, the first air he drew.<br />
He was excused the penalties of dull<br />
Minority. No tutor charged his hand<br />
With the thought-tracing quill, or task'd his mind<br />
With problems. History, not wanted yet,<br />
Lean'd on her elbow, watching Time, whose course<br />
Eventful should supply her with a theme.<br />

<p>Montgomery inscribed the following lines under
a drawing of the Yardley Oak, celebrated in the
preceding quotation from Cowper:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
The sole survivor of a race<br />
Of giant Oaks, where once the wood<br />
Bang with the battle or the chase,<br />
In stern and lonely grandeur stood.<br />
<br />
From age to age it slowly spread<br />
Its gradual boughs to sun and wind;<br />
From age to age its noble head<br />
As slowly wither'd and declined.<br />
<br />
A thousand years are like a day,<br />
When fled;&mdash;no longer known than seen;<br />
This tree was doom'd to pass away,<br />
And be as if it <i>ne'er</i> had been;&mdash;<br />
<br />
But mournful Cowper, wandering nigh,<br />
For rest beneath its shadow came,<br />
When, lo! the voice of days gone by<br />
Ascended from its hollow frame.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
<br />
O that the Poet had reveal'd<br />
The words of those prophetic strains,<br />
Ere death the eternal mystery seal'd<br />
&mdash;&mdash;Yet in his song the Oak remains.<br />
<br />
And fresh in undecaying prime,<br />
<i>There</i> may it live, beyond the power<br />
Of storm and earthquake, Man and Time,<br />
Till Nature's conflagration-hour.<br />
</p>

<p>There are various opinions as to the best mode
of rearing Oak-trees; we shall here state that which
Evelyn considered the best. In raising Oak-trees
from acorns sown in the seminary, a proper situation
should be prepared by the time the seeds are
ripe. The soil should be loamy, fresh, and in good
heart. This should be well prepared by digging,
breaking the clods, clearing it of weeds, stones, &amp;c.
The acorns should be collected from the best trees;
and if allowed to remain until they fall off, they
will germinate the better. Sow the acorns in beds
about three inches asunder, press them down gently
with the spade, and rake the earth over the acorns
until it is raised about two inches above them.
The plants will not appear in less than two months;
and here they may be allowed to remain for two
years at least, without any further care than keeping
them free from weeds, and occasionally refreshing
them with water in dry weather.</p>

<p>When the plants are two years old they will be
of a proper size for planting out, and the best way
to do this is by trenching or ploughing as deeply
as the soil will allow. The sets should be planted
about the end of October. This operation should
be commenced by striking the plants carefully out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the seed-bed, shortening the tap-root, and topping
off part of the side shoots, that there may be
an equal degree of strength in the stem and the
root. After planting they should be well protected
from cattle, and, if possible, from hares and rabbits.
They must also be kept clear from weeds.</p>

<p>Mr. Evelyn was of opinion, that Oaks thus raised
will yield the best timber. And Dr. Hunter remarks,
that the extensive plantations which were
made towards the end of the last century, were
made more with a view to shade and ornament
than to the propagation of good timber; and with
this object the owners planted their trees generally
too old, so that many of the woods, when they come
to be felled, will greatly disappoint the expectations
of the purchaser.</p>

<p>Oaks are about eighteen years old before they
yield any fruit, a peculiarity which seems to indicate
the great longevity of the tree; for "soon ripe
and soon rotten," is an adage that holds generally
throughout the organic world. The Oak requires
sixty or seventy years to attain a considerable
size; but it will go on increasing and knowing no
decay for centuries, and live for more than 1000
years.</p>

<p>In reference to the durability of Oak timber when
used in ship-building, the following statement has
been elicited by a Select Committee appointed to
inquire into the cause of the increased number of
shipwrecks. The Sub-Committee addressed a
letter to the Lords of the Admiralty, who consulted
the officers of the principal dock-yards, and returned

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Oriental Plane is a native of Greece, and of
other parts of the Levant; it is found in Asia
Minor, Persia, and eastward to Cashmere; and
likewise in Barbary, in the south of Italy, and in
Sicily, although probably not indigenous in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
countries. It appears to have been introduced into
England about the middle of the sixteenth century;
but seems not to have been propagated to the
extent it deserves, even as an ornamental tree;
and the specimens now in existence are neither
very numerous, nor are they distinguished for their
dimensions.</p>

<p>In the East, the Oriental Plane grows to the
height of seventy feet and upwards, with widely
spreading branches and a massive trunk; forming
altogether a majestic tree. The trunk is covered
with a smooth bark, which scales off every year in
large irregular patches, often producing a pleasing
variety of tint. The bark of the younger branches
is of a dark brown, inclined to a purple colour.
The leaves are alternate, about seven inches long
and eight broad, deeply cut into five segments, and
the two outer ones slightly cut into two more.
These segments are acutely indented on their borders,
each having a strong midrib, with numerous
lateral veins. The upper side of the leaves is a
deep green, the under side pale. The petioles are
rather long, with an enlargement at the base
which covers the nascent buds. The catkins which
contain the seed are of a globular form, and from
two to five in number, on axillary peduncles; they
vary greatly in size, and are found from four inches
to scarcely one in circumference. The flowers are
very minute. The balls, which are about the size
of walnuts, and fastened together often in pairs
like chain-shot, appear before the leaves in spring,
and the seed ripens late in autumn; these are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
small, not unlike the seed of the lettuce, and are
surrounded or enveloped in a bristly down.</p>

</div>

<p>Of the Oriental Plane Loudon remarks, "As an
ornamental tree, no one which attains so large a
size has a finer appearance, standing singly, or in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
small groups, upon a lawn, where there is room to
allow its lower branches, which stretch themselves
horizontally to a considerable distance, gracefully
to bend toward the ground, and turn up at their
extremities. The peculiar characteristics of the
tree, indeed, is the combination which it presents
of majesty and gracefulness; an expression which
is produced by the massive, and yet open and
varied character, of its head, the bending of its
branches, and their feathering to the ground. In
this respect it is greatly superior to the lime-tree,
which comes nearest to it in the general character
of the head; but which forms a much more compact
and lumpish mass of foliage in summer, and,
in winter, is so crowded with branches and spray,
as to prevent, in a great measure, the sun from
penetrating through them. The head of the
Oriental Plane, during sunshine, often abounds in
what painters call flickering lights; the consequence
of the branches of the head separating
themselves into what may be called horizontal
undulating strata&mdash;or, as it is called in artistic
phraseology, tufting&mdash;easily put in motion by the
wind, and through openings in which the rays of
the sun penetrate, and strike on the foliage below.
The tree is by no means so suitable, as most others,
for an extensive park, or for imitations of forest
scenery; but, from its mild and gentle expression,
its usefulness for shade in summer, and for admitting
the sun in winter, it is peculiarly adapted for
pleasure-grounds, and, where there is room, for
planting near houses and buildings. For the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
latter purpose, it is particularly well adapted even
in winter, for the colour of the bark of the trunk,
which has a grayish white tint, is not unlike the
colour of some kinds of freestone. The colour of
the foliage, in dry soil, is also of a dull grayish
green; which, receiving the light in numerous
horizontal tuftings, readily harmonizes with the
colour of stone walls. It appears, also, not to be
much injured by smoke, since there are trees of it
of considerable size in the very heart of London."</p>

<p>The Oriental Plane thrives best on a light free
soil, moist, but not wet at bottom; and the situation
should be sheltered, but not shaded or crowded
by other trees. It will scarcely grow in strong
clays and on elevated exposed places; nor will it
thrive in places where the lime-tree does not prosper.
It may be propagated by seeds, layers, or
cuttings. The general practice is to sow the seeds
in autumn, covering them over as lightly as those
of the birch and alder, or beating them in with
the back of the spade, and not covering them at
all, and protecting the beds with litter to exclude
the frost. The plants will come up the following
year, and will be fit, after two years' growth,
to run into nursery lines; from whence they may
be planted into their permanent stations in two
or three years, according to the size considered
necessary. The growth of this tree is very rapid,
attaining in the climate of London, under favourable
circumstances, the height of thirty feet in
ten years, and arriving at the height of sixty or
seventy feet in thirty years. The longevity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
this tree was supposed, by the ancients, to be considerable;
and there are few old trees in this
country. One, still existing at Lee Court, in Kent,
was celebrated in 1683 for its age and magnitude.
Some of the largest trees in the neighbourhood of
London are at Mount Grove, Hampstead, where
they are between seventy and eighty feet in height;
and in the grounds of Lambeth Palace, there is
one ninety feet high, with a trunk of four and a
half feet in diameter.</p>

<p>The Oriental Plane was held by the Greeks
sacred to Helen; and the virgins of Sparta are
represented by Theocritus as claiming homage for
it, saying, "Reverence me! I am the tree of
Helen." It was so admired by Xerxes, that Ælian
and other authors inform us, he halted his prodigious
army near one of them an entire day, during
its march for the invasion of Greece; and, on
leaving, covered it with gold, gems, necklaces,
scarfs, and bracelets, and an infinity of riches. He
likewise caused its figure to be stamped on a medal
of gold, which he afterwards wore continually
about him.</p>

<p>Among many remarkable Plane-trees recorded
by Pliny, he mentions one in Lycia, which had a
cave or hollow in the trunk that measured eighty-one
feet in circumference. In this hollow were
stone seats, covered with moss; and there, during
the time of his consulship, Licinius Mutianus, with
eighteen of his friends, was accustomed to dine
and sup! Its branches spread to such an amazing
extent, that this single tree appeared like a grove;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and this consul, says Pliny, chose rather to sleep
in the hollow cavity of this tree, than to repose in
his marble chamber, where his bed was richly
wrought with curious needlework, and o'ercanopied
with beaten gold. Pausanias, also, who lived
about the middle of the second century, records a
Plane-tree of remarkable size and beauty in
Arcadia, which was then supposed to have been
planted by the hands of Menelaus, the husband of
Helen, which would make the age of the tree
about thirteen hundred years.</p>

<p>At a later period magnificent examples of this
umbrageous tree continued to flourish in Greece,
and many of these are still existing. One of the
most celebrated is at Buyukdère (or the Great
Valley), about thirty miles from Constantinople,
which M. de Candolle conjectured to be more than
two thousand years old; when measured, in 1831,
by Dr. Walsh, it was found to be one hundred and
fifty-one feet in circumference at the base, and the
diameter of its head covered a space of one hundred
and thirty feet. Some doubt, however, seems
to exist as to whether it should be considered as a
single tree, or as a number of individuals which
have sprung from a decayed stock, and become
united at the base. The hollow contained within
the stem of this enormous tree, we are told, affords
a magnificent tent to the Seraskier and his officers,
when the Turks encamp in this valley.</p>

<p>Among the Turks, the Planes are preserved
with a devoted and religious tenderness.</p>

<h2>THE OCCIDENTAL OR AMERICAN PLANE.</h2>

<p class="blockquot">
[<i>Platanus occidentalis.</i> Nat. Ord.&mdash;<i>Platanaceæ</i>; Linn.&mdash;<i>Mon&oelig;c.
Polya.</i>]
</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> American or Western Plane is found over an
immense area in North America, comprising the
Atlantic and western states, and extending beyond
the Mississippi. In the Atlantic states, this tree
is commonly known by the name of button-wood;
and sometimes, in Virginia, by that of water-beech,
from its preferring moist localities, "where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
soil is loose, deep, and fertile." On the banks of
the Ohio, and in the states of Kentucky and Tennessee,
it is commonly called sycamore, and sometimes
plane-tree. The button-tree is, however, the
name by which this tree is most generally known
in America.</p>

<p>The Western Plane was first introduced into
England about 1630, and was afterwards so generally
planted, in consequence of its easy propagation
by cuttings and rapid growth, that it soon became
more common than <i>P. orientalis</i>. This tree is now,
however, rare in this country, from the greater
number having been killed by a severe frost in
May 1809, and by the severe winter of 1813-4.</p>

<p>The American Plane, in magnitude and general
appearance, closely resembles the oriental plane.
The one species, however, can always be distinguished
from the other by the following characters:&mdash;In
the Oriental Plane, the leaves are smaller
and much more deeply lobed than in the Western
tree, and the petioles of the leaves, which in the
Oriental species are green, in the American tree
are purplish-red; the fruit, or ball-shaped catkins,
also, of the Western Plane, are considerably
larger, and not so rough externally as those of
the other. The bark is said to scale off in larger
pieces, and the wood to be more curiously veined.
In all other respects, the descriptive particulars
of both trees are the same. According to
Michang, the Western Plane is "the loftiest and
largest tree of the United States." In 1802, he
saw one growing on the banks of the Ohio, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
girth at four feet from the ground, was 47 feet, or
nearly 16 feet in diameter. This tree, which
showed no symptoms of decay, but on the contrary
exhibited a rich foliage and vigorous vegetation,
began to ramify at about 20 feet from the ground,
a stem of no mean length, but short in comparison
to many large trees of this species that he
met with, whose boles towered to a height of 60
or 70 feet without a single branch. Even in
England, specimens of the Western Plane, of no
great age, are to be met with 100 feet in height.
The rate of growth of <i>P. occidentalis</i>, when placed
near water, is so rapid, that in ten years it will attain
the height of forty feet; and a tree in the
Palace Garden at Lambeth, near a pond, in twenty
years had attained the height of eighty feet, with
a trunk eight feet in circumference at three feet
from the ground, and the diameter of the head
forty-eight feet. This was in 1817.&mdash;(See Neill's
<i>Hort. Tour</i>, p. 9.)</p>

<p>As a picturesque tree, Gilpin places the Occidental
Plane after the oak, the ash, the elm, the
beech, and the hornbeam, which he considers as
deciduous trees of the first rank; saying of both
species of Platanus, that, though neither so beautiful
nor so characteristic as the first-named trees,
they are yet worth the notice of the eye of the
admirer of the picturesque.</p>

<span class="figcaption">Leaves and Flowers of <i>P. occidentalis</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>"The Occidental Plane has a very picturesque
stem. It is smooth, and of a light ash colour, and
has the property of throwing off its bark in scales;
thus naturally cleansing itself, at least its larger
boughs, from moss, and other parasitical encumbrances."
This would be no recommendation of it
in a picturesque light, if the removal of these encumbrances
did not substitute as great a beauty in
their room. These scales are very irregular, falling
off sometimes in one part, and sometimes in another;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and, as the under bark is, immediately after its
excoriation, of a lighter hue than the upper, it
offers to the pencil those smart touches which have
so much effect in painting. These flakes, however,
would be more beautiful if they fell off in a circular
form, instead of a perpendicular one: they would
correspond and unite better with the round form
of the bole. "No tree forms a more pleasing shade
than the Occidental Plane. It is full-leafed, and its
leaf is large, smooth, of a fine texture, and seldom
injured by insects. Its lower branches shooting
horizontally, soon take a direction to the ground,
and the spray seems more sedulous than that of any
tree we have, by twisting about in various forms, to
fill up every little vacuity with shade. At the same
time, it must be owned that the twisting of its
branches is a disadvantage to this tree, as it is to
the beech. When it is stripped of its leaves, and
reduced to a skeleton, it has not the natural appearance
which the spray of the oak, and that of many
other trees, discovers in winter; nor, indeed, does
its foliage, from the largeness of the leaf and the
mode of its growth, make the most picturesque
appearance in summer. One of the finest Occidental
Planes I am acquainted with stands in my
own garden at Vicar's Hill; where its boughs,
feathering to the ground, form a canopy of above
fifty feet in diameter."</p>

<p>The Occidental Plane is propagated by cuttings,
which will hardly fail to succeed if they are taken
from strong young wood, and are planted early in
the autumn in a moist good mould.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Poplars are deciduous trees, mostly growing
to a large size; natives of Europe, North America,
some parts of Asia, and the north of Africa. They
are all of rapid growth, some of them extremely so;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and they are all remarkable for a tremulous motion
in their leaves, when agitated by the least breath
of wind. The species delight in a rich, moist soil,
in the neighbourhood of running water, but they
do not thrive in marshes or soils saturated with
stagnant moisture. Their wood is light, of a white
or pale yellowish colour, very durable when kept
dry, not liable to warp or twist when sawn up, and
yields, from its elasticity, without splitting or cracking
when struck with violence; that of some species
is also very slow in taking fire, and burns, when
ignited, in a smouldering manner, without flame, on
which account it is valuable, and extensively used
for the flooring of manufactories and other buildings.
Of the fifteen species of Poplar described
in Loudon's <i>Arboretum</i>, three are believed to be
natives of this country&mdash;<i>P. canescens</i>, <i>P. tremula</i>,
and <i>P. nigra</i>.</p>

<p><i>P. canescens</i>, the Gray or Common White Poplar,
and its different varieties, form trees of from eighty
to one hundred feet high and upwards, with silvery
smooth bark, upright and compact branches, and a
clear trunk, to a considerable height, and a spreading
head, usually in full-grown trees, but thinly
clothed with foliage. The leaves are roundish, deeply
waved, lobed, and toothed; downy beneath, chiefly
grayish; leaves of young shoots cordate-ovate, undivided
fertile catkins cylindrical. Stigmas 8.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px;">

<img src="images/pg_203.png" width="441" height="615" alt="" />
<span class="figcaption">Leaves, Flowers, and Catkins of <i>P. canescens</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The White Poplar is commonly propagated by
layers, which ought to be transplanted into nursery
lines for at least one year before removal to their
final situation. The tree is admirably adapted for
thickening or filling up blanks in woods and plantations;
and, for this purpose, truncheons may be
planted from three to four inches in diameter, and
from ten to twelve feet high. These truncheons
have the great advantage of not being overshadowed
by the adjoining trees, which is almost always the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
case when young plants are used for filling up
vacancies among old trees. In a moderately good
and moist soil, the White Poplar will attain in ten
years, the height of thirty feet or upwards, with a
trunk from six to nine inches in diameter.</p>

<p>As an ornamental tree, the White Poplar is not
unworthy of a place in extensive parks and grounds,
particularly when planted in lone situations, or
near to water; it ought, however, to be grouped
and massed with trees of equally rapid growth, else
it soon becomes disproportionate, and out of keeping
with those whose progress is comparatively
slow. It is well adapted in our climate for a wayside
tree, as it has no side branches to prevent the
admission of light and free circulation of air; and
also to form avenues, when an effect is wished to
be produced in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>The Aspen or Trembling Poplar, <i>P. tremula</i>, is
inferior to few of its tribe, presenting the appearance
of a tall, and, in proportion to its height,
rather a slender tree, with a clean straight trunk;
the head ample, and formed of horizontal growing
branches, not crowded together, which assume, towards
the extremities, a drooping or pendulous
direction. The leaves are nearly orbicular, sinuate,
or toothed, smooth on both sides; foot-stalks compressed;
young branches hairy; stigmas 4, crested
and eared at the base. The foliage is of a fine rich
green; and the upper surface of the leaves being
somewhat darker than the under, a sparkling and
peculiar effect is produced by the almost constant
tremulous motion with which they are affected by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the slightest breath of air, and which is produced
by the peculiar form of the foot-stalks, which in
this species is flattened, or vertically compressed
in relation to the plane of the leaf, causing a quivering
or double lateral motion, instead of the usual
waving motion, where the foot-stalk is round, or
else compressed horizontally.</p>

<p>The Black Poplar, <i>P. nigra</i>, is a tree of the
largest size, with an ample head, composed of numerous
branches and terminal shoots. The bark
is ash-coloured, and becomes rough and deeply furrowed
with age. The catkins are bipartite, cylindrical;
the barren appear in March or April, long
before the expansion, of the leaves, and, being large
and of a deep red colour, produce a rich effect at
that early period of the year. The capsules or seed-vessels
of the fertile catkin are round, and contain
a pure white cottony down, in which the seeds are
enveloped. The leaves appear about the middle
of May, and, when they first expand, their colour
is a mixture of red and yellow; afterwards they
are of a pale light green, with yellowish foot-stalks;
remarkably triangular, acuminate, serrate, smooth
on both sides; stigmas 4.</p>

<p>There is a Black Poplar at Alloa House, in
Clackmannanshire, which, in 1782, at the height
of between three and four feet from the ground,
measured thirteen feet and a half in circumference.
There is also a very graceful and beautiful tree of
the same species at Bury St. Edmunds, ninety feet
in height, and which measures, at the distance of
three feet from the ground, fifteen feet in girth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
The trunk rises forty-five feet before it divides,
when it throws out a vast profusion of branches.</p>

<p>The Poplar was dedicated by the Romans to Hercules,
in honour of his having destroyed the monster
Cacus in a cavern near to the Aventine Mount,
where the Poplar formerly flourished in abundance.
In Pitt's translation of Virgil, the following reference
is made to the rite of crowning with the
Poplar:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
From that blest hour th' Arcadian tribe bestowed<br />
Those solemn honours on their guardian god.<br />

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Scotch Fir or Pine, and its varieties, are indigenous
throughout the greater part of Europe. It
also extends into the north, east, and west of Asia;
and is found at Nootka Sound in Vancouver's
Island, on the north-west coast of North America.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
In the south of Europe it grows at an elevation
of from 1000 to 1500 feet; in the Highlands of
Scotland, at 2700 feet; and in Norway and Lapland,
at 700 feet. Widely dispersed, however, as
the species is throughout the mountainous regions
of Europe, it is only found in profusion between
52° and 65° N. lat. It occurs in immense forests
in Poland and Russia, as well as in northern Germany,
Sweden, Norway, and Lapland, up to the
70° of N. lat. The indigenous forests of Scotland,
which formerly occupied so large a portion of its
surface, have been greatly reduced within the last
sixty years, chiefly on account of the pecuniary
embarrassments of their proprietors.</p>

</div>

<p>The Scotch Fir, in favourable situations, attains
the height of from eighty to one hundred feet, with
a trunk from two to four feet in diameter, and a
head somewhat conical or rounded, but generally
narrow in proportion to its height, as compared
with the heads of other broad-leafed trees. The
bark is of a reddish tinge, comparatively smooth,
scaling off in some varieties, and rough and furrowed
in others. The branches are disposed in
whorls from two to four together, and sometimes
five or six; they are at first slightly turned upwards,
but finally become somewhat pendant, with
the exception of those branches which form the
summit of the tree. The leaves are in sheaths,
spirally disposed on the branches; they are distinguished
at first sight from all other pines in which
the leaves are in pairs, by being much more glaucous,
more especially when in a young state, and
straighter. The general length of the leaves, in
vigorous young trees, is from two to three inches;
but in old trees they are much shorter; they are
smooth on both surfaces, stiff, obtuse at the extremities,
with a small point, and minutely serrated;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
dark green on the upper side, and glaucous and
striated on the under side. The leaves remain
green on the tree during four years, and generally
drop off at the commencement of the fifth year,
Long before this time, generally at the beginning
of the second year, they have entirely lost their light
glaucous hue, and have become of the dark sombre
appearance which is characteristic of this tree at
every season except that of summer, when the
young glaucous shoots of the year give it a lighter
hue. The flowers appear commonly in May and
June. The barren flowers are from half an inch
to upwards of an inch long, are placed in whorls
at the base of the young shoots of the current year,
and contain two or more stamens with large yellow
anthers, which discharge a sulphur-coloured pollen
in great abundance. The fertile flowers, or embryo
cones, appear on the summits of the shoots of the
current year, generally two on the point of a shoot,
but sometimes from four to six. The colour of
these embryo cones is generally purple and green;
but they are sometimes yellowish or red. It requires
eighteen months to mature the cones; and
in a state of nature it is two years before the seeds
are in a condition to germinate. The cone, which
is stalked, and, when mature, begins to open at the
narrow extremity, is perfectly conical while closed,
rounded at the base, from one to two inches in
length, and about an inch across in the broadest
part; as it ripens, the colour changes from green
to reddish brown. The scales of the cone are oblong,
and terminate externally in a kind of depressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
pyramid, which varies in shape and height. At
the base of each scale, and close to the axis of the
cone, two oval-winged seeds or nuts are lodged.
From these nuts the young plant appears in the
shape of a slender stem, with from five to six linear
leaves or cotyledons. In ten years, in the climate
of London, plants will attain the height of from
twenty-five to thirty feet; and in twenty years,
from forty to fifty feet.</p>

<p>The great contempt in which the Scotch Fir is
commonly held, says Gilpin, "arises, I believe,
from two causes&mdash;its dark murky hue is unpleasing,
and we rarely see it in a picturesque state. In
perfection it is a very picturesque tree, though
we have little idea of its beauty. It is a hardy
plant, and is therefore put to every servile office.
If you wish to screen your house from the south-west
wind, plant Scotch Firs; and plant them
close and thick. If you want to shelter a nursery
of young trees, plant Scotch Firs; and the phrase
is, you may afterwards weed them out as you please.
I admire its foliage, both for the colour of the leaf,
and its mode of growth. Its ramification, too, is
irregular and beautiful, and not unlike that of the
stone pine; which it resembles also in the easy
sweep of its stem, and likewise in the colour of
the bark, which is commonly, as it attains age, of
a rich reddish brown. The Scotch Fir, indeed, in
its stripling state, is less an object of beauty. Its
pointed and spiry shoots, during the first years of
its growth, are formal; and yet I have sometimes
seen a good contrast produced between its spiry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
points and the round-headed oaks and elms in its
neighbourhood. When I speak, however, of the
Scotch Fir as a beautiful individual, I conceive it
when it has outgrown all the improprieties of its
youth; when it has completed its full age, and when,
like Ezekiel's cedar, it has formed its head high
among the thick branches. I may be singular in
my attachment to the Scotch Fir. I know it has
many enemies; but my opinion will weigh only
with the reasons I have given." Sir Thomas Dick
Lauder, in his commentary on this passage, says,
"We agree with Gilpin to the fullest extent in his
approbation of the Scotch Fir as a picturesque tree.
We, for our part, confess, that we have seen it
towering in full majesty, in the midst of some
appropriate Highland scene, and sending its limbs
abroad with all the unconstrained freedom of a
hardy mountaineer, as if it claimed dominion over
the savage regions around it; we have then looked
upon it as a very sublime object. People who
have not seen it in its native climate and soil, and
who judge of it from the wretched abortions which
are swaddled and suffocated in English plantations,
in deep, heavy, and eternally wet clays, may well
call it a wretched tree; but, when its foot is among
its own Highland heather, and when it stands freely
on its native knoll of dry gravel, or thinly covered
rock, over which its roots wander afar in the wildest
reticulation, whilst its tall, furrowed, and often
gracefully sweeping red and gray trunk, of enormous
circumference, rears aloft its high umbrageous
canopy, then would the greatest sceptic on this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
point be compelled to prostrate his mind before it
with a veneration which, perhaps, was never before
excited in him by any other tree."</p>

<p>Some of the most picturesque trees of this kind,
perhaps, in England, adorn Mr. Lenthall's mansion,
of Basilsleigh, in Berkshire. The soil is a deep
rich sand, which seems to be well adapted to them.
As they are here at perfect liberty, they not only
become large and noble trees, but they expand
themselves likewise in all the careless forms of
nature.</p>

<p>There is a remarkably fine specimen of the
Scotch Fir at Castle Huntly, in Perthshire. In
1796, it measured thirteen feet six inches in girth,
at three feet from the ground; and close to the
ground, it measured nineteen feet, and is thought
not unlikely to be the largest planted Fir in the
country. The word <i>planted</i> is very properly used
here, as many examples of larger <i>natural</i> Firs have
been produced. Professor Walker observes, that
few Fir-trees were planted before the beginning of
the present century; and that as the Fir is a tree
which, from the number of rings found in it, will
probably grow four hundred years, it is impossible
that the planted Firs can have arrived at perfection.
"This," says Sir T. Lauder, "may be all
true; but as the reasoning proceeds upon the fact
of a natural Swedish tree, perfectly sound, having
three hundred and sixty circles in it, it by no
means follows that a planted Fir will not rot in a
premature state of disease, and die before it has
sixty circles."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The acerose or needle leaf of the Pine seems
necessary to protect the tree from injury; for if
their leaves were of a broader form, the branches
would be borne down, in winter, by the weight of
snow in the northern latitudes, and they would be
more liable to be uprooted by the mighty hurricane.
It is, however, enabled thus to evade both; as the
snow falls through, and the winds penetrate between,
the interstices of its filiform leaf. Struggling
through the branches, the wind comes in contact
with such an innumerable quantity of points
and edges, as, even when gentle, to produce a deep
murmur, or sighing; but when the breeze is strong,
or the storm is raging abroad, it produces sounds
like the murmuring of the ocean, or the beating
of the surge and billows among the rocks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
The loud wind through the forest wakes<br />
With sounds like ocean roaring, wild and deep,<br />
And in yon gloomy Pines strange music makes,<br />
like symphonies unearthly heard in sleep;<br />
The sobbing waters wash their waves and weep:<br />
Where moans the blast its dreary path along,<br />
The bending Firs a mournful cadence keep,<br />
And mountain rocks re-echo to the song,<br />
As fitful raves the wind the hills and woods among.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 21em;"><span class="smcap">Drummond.</span></span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Wordsworth, also, thus speaks of Pine-trees moved
by a gentle breeze:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
An idle voice the Sabbath region fills<br />
Of deep that calls to deep across the hills,<br />
Broke only by the melancholy sound<br />
Of drowsy bells for ever tinkling round;<br />
Faint wail of eagle melting into blue<br />
Beneath the cliffs, and Pine-wood's steady sugh.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The quality of the timber of the Scotch Fir,
according to some, is altogether dependent on soil,
climate, and slowness of growth; but, according
to others, it depends jointly on these circumstances,
and on the kind of variety cultivated. It is acknowledged
that the timber of the Scotch Fir,
grown on rocky surfaces, or where the soil is dry
and sandy, is generally more resinous and redder
in colour, than that of such as grow on soils
of a clayey nature, boggy, or on chalk. At what
time the sap wood is transformed into durable or
red wood, has not yet been determined by vegetable
physiologists. The durability of the red timber of
this tree was supposed by Brindley, the celebrated
engineer, to be as great as that of the oak; and
some of it, grown in the north Highlands, is reported
to have been as fresh and full of resin after
having been three hundred years in the roof of an
old castle, as newly-imported timber from Memel.</p>

<p>The red wood timber of the Scottish forests,
similar, in every respect, to the best Baltic Pine,
is the produce of trees that have numbered from
one to two or more centuries. In Norway, it is
not considered full-grown timber till it has reached
from one hundred and thirty to two hundred years.
It seems, then, rather preposterous, that any one
should expect that plantation Fir timber, cut down
when, perhaps, not more than thirty years old, and
consisting entirely of sap wood, should be adapted
to all those purposes which require the best full-grown
and matured timber; and yet such seems
very generally to have been the case, and to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
disappointment at not finding those expectations
realized, may be attributed a large portion of that
prejudice and dislike so generally entertained towards
this tree.</p>

<p>On Hampstead Heath, near London, there are a
number of Pines which are said to have been raised
from seed brought from Ravenna. If so, the cones
are very different from those of the Ravenna Pine
described by Leigh Hunt:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Various the trees and passing foliage there,&mdash;<br />
Wild pear, and oak, and dusky juniper,<br />
With bryony between in trails of white,<br />
And ivy, and the suckle's streaky light,<br />
And moss warm gleaming with a sudden mark,<br />
Like flings of sunshine left upon the bark;<br />
And still the Pine long-haired, and dark, and tall,<br />
In lordly right, predominant o'er all.<br />
<br />
Much they admire that old religious tree,<br />
With shaft above the rest up-shooting free,<br />
And shaking, when its dark locks feel the wind,<br />
Its wealthy fruit with rough Mosaic rind.<br />

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Silver Fir is indigenous to the mountains of
Central Europe, and to the west and north of Asia,
rising to the commencement of the zone of the
Scotch fir. It is found in France, on the Pyrenees,
the Alps, and the Vosges; in Italy, Spain, Greece,
and the south of Germany; also in Russia and
Siberia; but it is not found indigenous in Britain
or Ireland. On the Carpathian mountains it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
found to the height of 3200 feet; and on the Alps,
to the height of from 3000 to 4000 feet. Wherever
it is found of a large size, as in the neighbourhood
of Strasburg, and in the Vosges, where it has
attained the height of one hundred and fifty feet,
it invariably grows in good soil, and in a situation
sheltered rather than exposed. It appears to have
been introduced into England about the commencement
of the seventeenth century; as we learn from
Evelyn, that in 1663 there were two Silver Firs
growing at Harefield, Middlesex, which were there
planted sixty years before, at two years' growth
from the seed, the larger of which had risen to
the height of 81 feet, and was 13 feet in girth
below; and it was calculated that it contained 146
feet of good timber.</p>

<span class="figcaption">Foliage and Cones of <i>A. picea</i>, or <i>Picea</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>In full-grown trees, the trunk of the Silver Fir
is from six to eight feet in diameter, covered, till
its fortieth or fiftieth year, with a whitish-gray
bark, tolerably smooth; but, as it increases in
age, it becomes cracked and chapped. At a still
greater age, the bark begins to scale off in large
pieces, leaving the trunk of a dark brown colour
beneath. The branches stand out horizontally,
as do the branchlets and spray, with reference to
the main stem of the branch. The leaves on
young trees are distinctly two-rowed, and the
general surface of the rows is flat; but, as the
tree advances in age, and especially on cone-bearing
shoots, the disposition of the leaves is less perfect.
In every stage of growth they are turned
up at the points; but more especially so on old
trees, and on cone-bearing branches. The leaves
are shorter and broader, and are set much thicker
on the spray, than those of other firs and pines.
The upper surface of the leaves is also of a darker
and brighter green, while underneath they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
two white silvery lines running lengthwise on each
side of the midrib, which make a conspicuous appearance
on the partially turned up leaves; whence
its name. The cones of the Silver Fir are large
and cylindrical, being from six to eight inches
long, erect, and bluntly pointed at both ends.
When young they are green, but, as they advance
to maturity, the scales acquire a rich purplish
colour, and when quite ripe are deep brown; they
remain upwards of a year upon the tree, as they
first appear in May, when they blossom, and do
not ripen the seed till October of the following
year. The scales are large, with a long dorsal
bract, and fall from the axillar spindle of the cone
in the spring of the second year. The seeds are
irregular and angular, with a large membranaceous
wing. Cones with fertile seeds are seldom produced
before the tree has attained its fortieth year;
though without, seeds often appear before half that
period has elapsed.</p>

<p>Gilpin remarks that "the Silver Fir has very
little to boast in point of picturesque beauty. It
has all the regularity of the spruce, but without
its floating foliage. There is a sort of harsh, stiff,
unbending formality in the stem, the branches,
and the whole economy of the tree, which makes
it disagreeable. We rarely see it, even in its
happiest state, assume a picturesque shape." In
this opinion Sir T. D. Lauder does not entirely
coincide, for, in his remarks upon Gilpin's text, he
says, "As to the picturesque effect of this tree, we
have seen many of them throw out branches from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
near the very root, that twined and swept away
from them in so bold a manner, as to give them,
in a very great degree, that character which is
most capable of engaging the interest of the artist."</p>

<p>The rate of growth of the Silver Fir is slow
when young, but rapid after it has attained the
age of ten or twelve years. In England, under
advantageous circumstances, it attains a magnificent
size, some recorded trees being from 100
to 130 feet in height, with trunks varying in
diameter from three to six feet, and containing
from two hundred to upwards of three hundred
feet of timber. In Scotland, also, it has reached
dimensions equally great. At Roseneath Castle,
Argyleshire, there are two Silver Firs which
Sir T. D. Lauder considered the finest specimens
he had ever seen. When measured in 1817,
he says, "the circumference of one of them, at
five feet from the ground, was fifteen feet nine
inches; at three feet from the ground, it was seventeen
feet six inches; and just above the roots, it
was nineteen feet eight inches. The second tree
was sixteen feet two inches in girth at five feet from
the ground; seventeen feet eleven inches at three
feet from the ground; and nineteen feet ten inches
when measured immediately above the roots."
The Silver Fir likewise grows to a large size in
Ireland, much more rapidly than any other tree.
Some planted in a wet clay, on a rock, have
measured twelve feet in girth at the base, and
seven feet six inches at five feet high, after a
growth of forty years.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Though</span> a native of the mountains of Europe and
Asia in similar parallels of latitude, the Spruce
Fir is not considered indigenous to Britain. It
must, however, have been introduced at an early
period, as it is mentioned by our oldest writers on
arboriculture. It is most common in Lapland,
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and throughout the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
north of Germany. It grows in the south of
Norway at an elevation of 3000 feet above the
level of the sea, and in the north on mountains
in 70° N. lat. at 750 feet. In the valleys of the
Swiss Alps, the Spruce is frequently found above
one hundred and fifty feet in height, with trunks
from four to five feet in diameter. This tree
requires a soft moist soil. Among dry rocks and
stones, where the Scotch fir would flourish, the
Spruce Fir will scarcely grow.</p>

<p>The Norway Spruce Fir is the loftiest of European
trees, attaining, in favourable situations, the
enormous height of one hundred and eighty feet;
with a very straight upright trunk, from two to six
feet in diameter, and widely extending branches,
which spread out regularly on every side, so as to
form a cone-like or pyramidal shape, terminating
in a straight arrow-like leading shoot. In young
trees, the branches are disposed in regular whorls
from the base to the summit; but in old trees the
lower branches drop off. The trunk is covered
with a thin bark, of a reddish colour and scaly surface,
with occasional warts or small excrescences
distributed over its surface. The leaves are solitary,
of a dark grassy green, generally under one
inch in length, straight, stiff, and sharp-pointed,
disposed around the shoots, and more crowded
together laterally than on the upper and under
sides of the branchlets. The barren flowers,
about one inch long, are cylindrical, on long catkins,
curved, of a yellowish colour, with red tips,
and discharging, when expanded, a profusion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
yellow pollen. The fertile flowers are produced at
the ends of the branches, first appearing as small
pointed purplish-red catkins; they afterwards
gradually assume the cone-like form, and become
pendant, changing first into a green and latterly
into a reddish brown, acquiring a length of from
five to seven inches, and a breadth of above two
inches. The scales are rhomboidal, slightly incurved,
and rugged or toothed at the tip, with two
seeds in each scale. The seeds, which are very
small, and furnished with large membranous wings,
are not shed till the spring of the second year.</p>

<p>As an ornamental tree, all admirers of regularity
and symmetry are generally partial to the
Spruce. Gilpin was, however, no great admirer
of the tree; but still he allows it to have had its
peculiar beauties. "The Spruce Fir," he says, "is
generally esteemed a more elegant tree than the
Scotch pine; and the reason, I suppose, is because
it often feathers to the ground, and grows in a
more exact and regular shape: but this is a principal
objection to it. It often wants both form
and beauty. We admire its floating foliage, in
which it sometimes exceeds all other trees; but
it is rather disagreeable to see a repetition of these
feathery strata, beautiful as they are, reared tier
above tier, in regular order, from the bottom of a
tree to the top. Its perpendicular stem, also,
which has seldom any lineal variety, makes the
appearance of the tree still more formal. It is
not always, however, that the Spruce Fir grows
with so much regularity. Sometimes a lateral
branch, here and there taking the lead beyond the
rest, breaks somewhat through the order commonly
observed, and forms a few chasms, which have a
good effect. When this is the case, the Spruce
Fir ranks among picturesque trees. Sometimes it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
has as good an effect, and in many circumstances
a better, when the contrast appears still stronger;
when the tree is shattered by some accident, has
lost many of its branches, and is scathed and ragged.
A feathery branch, here and there, among broken
stems, has often an admirable effect; but it must
arise from some particular situation. In all circumstances,
however, the Spruce Fir appears best
either as a single tree, or unmixed with any of its
fellows; for neither it, nor any of the spear-headed
race, will ever form a beautiful clump without the
assistance of other trees."</p>

<p>The Spruce Fir is raised from seed, which should
be chosen from healthy vigorous trees. The young
plant appears with from seven to nine cotyledons,
but makes little progress till after the third year,
when it begins to put out lateral branches. Its
progress from this time, till its fifth or sixth year,
is at the annual rate of about six inches, after
which age its annual growth, in favourable soils,
is very rapid, the leading shoot being frequently
from two to three feet in length, and this increase
it continues to support with undiminished vigour
for forty or fifty years, many trees within that
period attaining a height of from sixty to eighty
feet. Its growth after this period is slower, and
the duration of the tree, in its native habitats, is
considered to range between one hundred and one
hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">Turner</span>, who wrote in 1551, considered the Sycamore
as a stranger, or tree that had been introduced.
On the Continent it is spread over the
mountains of middle Europe; and is found in
Switzerland, where it particularly abounds, growing
at an elevation of from 2000 to 3000 feet
above the level of the sea, where the soil is dry
and of a good quality.</p>

<span class="figcaption">Leaves, Bunch of Flowers, and Samaræ of <i>A. pseudo-platanus</i>.</span>

<p>The Sycamore is "certainly a noble tree," vieing,
in point of magnitude, with the oak, the ash, and
other trees of the first rank. It presents a grand
unbroken mass of foliage, contrasting well, in appropriate
situations, with trees of a lighter and
more airy character. It has round spreading
branches, and a smooth ash-coloured bark, frequently
broken into patches of different hues, by
peeling off in large flakes, like the planes. The
leaves have long foot-stalks, are four or five inches
broad, palmate, with five acute, unequally serrated
lobes; the middle one largest, pale or shining
beneath. The flowers are green, the size of a
currant blossom, disposed into axillary, pendulous,
compound clusters; stamens of the barren flower
twice as long as the corolla. Ovary downy,
with broad-spreading wings. Selby observes that
"from the strength of its spray, and the nature of
its growth, which is stiff and angular, the Sycamore
is especially calculated to act as a shelter or break-wind
in exposed situations, whether it be upon the
coast where it braves the cutting eastern blasts,
or upon bleak and elevated tracts, subject to long
continued and powerful winds; for even in such
localities, provided the soil be dry, and of tolerable
quality, it attains a respectable size, and shows an
upright form, unconquered by the blast. It is,
probably, for these peculiar and enduring qualities
that we see it so frequently in the north of England
and in Scotland planted by itself, or sometimes
in company with the ash, around farm houses and
cottages, in high and exposed situations." This
custom is evidently alluded to by the Westmoreland

poet, in his description of the landscape on the

The wild green landscape. Once again I see<br />
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines<br />
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms<br />
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke,<br />
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!<br />
With some uncertain notice, as might seem<br />
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,<br />
Or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire<br />
The hermit sits alone.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">These beauteous forms,</span><br />
Through a long absence, have not been to me<br />
As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:<br />
But oft, in lonely rooms, and 'mid the din<br />
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,<br />
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,<br />
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;<br />
And passing even into my purer mind,<br />
With tranquil restoration:&mdash;feelings, too,<br />
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,<br />
As have no slight or trivial influence<br />
On that best portion of a good man's life,<br />
His little, nameless, unremembered acts<br />
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,<br />
To them I may have owed another gift,<br />
Of aspect more sublime: that blessed mood,<br />
In which the burthen of the mystery&mdash;<br />
In which the heavy and the weary weight<br />
Of all this unintelligible world<br />
Is lightened:&mdash;that serene and blessed mood,<br />
In which the affections gently lead us on,<br />
Until the breath of this corporeal frame,<br />
And even the motion of our human blood,<br />
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br />
In body, and become a living soul:<br />
While with an eye made quiet by the power<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br />
We see into the life of things.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">If this</span><br />
Be but a vain belief, yet, O! how oft,<br />
In darkness, and amid the many shapes<br />
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir<br />
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,<br />
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart,<br />
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,<br />
O sylvan Wye! Thou wanderer thro' the woods,<br />
How often has my spirit turned to thee!<br />

<p>The Sycamore is not unfrequently planted in
streets and before houses, on account of its spreading
branches and thick shade, for which it bears
a high reputation. Of this tree Sir T. D. Lauder
says, "the spring tints are rich, tender, glowing,
and harmonious. In summer, its deep green hue
accords well with its grand and massy form; and
the browns and dingy reds of its autumnal tints
harmonize well with the other colours of the mixed
grove, to which they give a depth of tone. It is a
favourite Scotch tree, having been much planted
about old aristocratic residences in Scotland."</p>

<p>The Sycamore, in the language of flowers, signifies
curiosity, because it was supposed to be the
"tree on which Zaccheus climbed to see Christ
pass on his way to Jerusalem, when the people
strewed leaves and branches of palm and other
trees in his way, exclaiming, 'Hosanna to the Son
of David!' The tree which is frequently called
the Sycamore in the Bible, was not the species
under description, <i>A. pseudo-platanus</i>, but a species
of fig, <i>Ficus sycomorus</i>, a native of Egypt, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
it is a timber-tree exceeding the middle size, and
bearing edible fruit."</p>

<p>The common Sycamore is generally propagated
by seed; and its varieties by layers, or by budding
or grafting. It will also propagate freely by cuttings
of the roots. It is a tree of rapid growth,
frequently attaining a diameter of from four to five
inches in twenty years. It arrives at its full growth
in fifty or sixty years; but it requires to be eighty
or one hundred years old before its wood arrives
at perfection. It produces fertile seeds at the age
of twenty years, but flowers several years sooner.
The longevity of the tree is from one hundred and
forty to two hundred years, though it has been
known of a much greater age. There are many
fine Sycamores in different parts of the kingdom;
the largest of which, one at Bishopton in Renfrewshire,
is sixty feet in height and twenty feet in
girth. This tree is known to have been planted
before the Reformation, and is therefore more than
three hundred years old, yet it has the appearance
of being perfectly sound.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Walnut tree is a native of Persia, and is found
growing wild in the North of China. It was known
to the Greeks and Romans, and was probably introduced
into this country by the latter. It is now
to be met with in every part of Europe, as far north
as Warsaw; but it is nowhere so far naturalized
as to produce itself spontaneously from seed. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ripens its fruit, in fine seasons, in the neighbourhood
of Edinburgh, as a standard; and it lives
against a wall as far north as Dunrobin Castle, in
Sutherlandshire.</p>

<p>The Walnut forms a large and lofty tree, with
strong spreading branches, attaining even in this
country to the height of ninety feet. The leaves
have three or four pairs of oval leaflets, terminated
by an odd one, which is longer than the rest. The
barren catkins are pendulous, and are produced
near the points of the shoots. The bark is thick
and deeply furrowed on the trunk; but on the
upper branches it is gray and smooth. The fruit
is green and oval; and, in the wild species, contains
a small hard nut. In the most esteemed cultivated
varieties, the fruit is of a roundish oval, and is
strongly odoriferous; nearly two inches long, and
one and a half broad. The nut occupies two-thirds
of the volume of the fruit. Towards autumn the
husk softens, and, decaying from about the nut,
allows it to fall out.</p>

<p>The nuts are used in different ways, and at
various stages of their growth; when young and
green, and before the shells become indurated, they
make an excellent and well-known pickle, as well
as a savoury kind of ketchup, and a liqueur is also
made from them in this state. Previous to their
becoming fully ripe, and while the kernel is yet
soft, they are eaten in France with a seasoning of
salt, pepper, vinegar, and shallots. When fully ripe,
they are both wholesome and easy of digestion, so
long as they remain fresh, and part freely from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the pellicle, or skin, which envelopes the kernel.
An oil is expressed from the nuts, which is of great
service to the artist in whites, and other colours,
and also for gold size and varnish.</p>

</div>

<p>When Walnuts are plentiful, it has been observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
that there is also a plentiful harvest. Virgil mentions
this observation in the first of his <i>Georgics</i>,
which is thus translated by Martyn:&mdash;"Observe
also when the Walnut tree shall put on its bloom
plentifully in the woods, and bend down its strong,
swelling branches: if it abounds in fruit, you will
have a like quantity of corn, and a great threshing
with much heat. But if it abounds with a luxuriant
shade of leaves, in vain shall your floor thresh the
corn, which abounds with nothing but chaff."</p>

<p>The Walnut is far from being an unpicturesque
tree, and planted at some distance from each other
they form shady and graceful avenues, and prosper
well in hedge-rows. The Bergstras (which extends
from Heidelberg to Darmstadt) is planted entirely
with this tree; for by an ancient law, the Borderers
were compelled to plant and train them up,
chiefly on account of their ornament and shade,
so that a man might ride for miles about that
country, under a continued arbour or close walk&mdash;the
traveller as well refreshed by its fruit as by its
shade. Amid other trees whose foliage may be of
a vivid green, its warm, russet-hued leaves present
a pleasing variety about the end of May; and in
summer that variety is still preserved by the contrast
of its yellowish hues with the darker tints of
other trees. It puts forth its leaves at such an
advanced period of the year, and sheds them so
early, that it is never long in harmony with the
grove. It, therefore, stands best alone, as the
premature loss of its foliage is then of less consequence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>The Walnut tree is found abundantly in Burgundy,
where it stands in the midst of their corn
fields, at distances of sixty and a hundred feet,
and is said to be a preserver of the crops by keeping
the ground warm. Whenever a tree is felled,
which is only when old and decayed, a young one
is planted near it; and in Evelyn's time, between
Hanau and Frankfort, in Germany, no young farmer
was permitted to marry a wife, until he had
brought proof that he had planted a stated number
of these trees. M. Sorbiere mentions the Dutch
plantations of Walnut trees in terms of praise, remarking,
that even in the very roads and common
highways, they are better preserved and maintained
than those about the houses and gardens belonging
to the nobility and gentry of most other countries.</p>

<p>The Walnut was formerly in great request as a
timber-tree; its place is generally now supplied by
foreign woods, which excel that of our own growth.
It was much used by cabinet-makers for bedsteads,
and bureaus, for which purposes it is one of the
most durable woods of English growth. It is also
used for gun-stocks. Near the root of the tree the
wood is finely veined&mdash;suitable for inlaying and
other ornamental works.</p>

<p class="poem">

Polished with care, adds to the workman's art<br />

<span class="smcap" style="padding-left: 15em;">Dodsley.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Walnut is propagated by the nut; which is
best sown where it is finally to remain, on account
of the tap-root, which will thus have its full influence
on the vigour of the tree. The plant is somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
tender when young, and apt to be injured by
spring frosts: it, however, grows vigorously, and
attains in the climate of London the height of
twenty feet in ten years, beginning about that time
to bear fruit.</p>

<p>The Walnut sometimes attains a prodigious size
and a great age. Scamozzi, a celebrated Italian
architect, who died in 1616, mentions his having
seen at St. Nicholas, in Lorraine, a single plank of
the wood of this tree twenty-five feet wide, upon
which the Emperor Frederick III. had given a
sumptuous feast.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable specimen of this tree at
Kinross House, in Kinross-shire, which measured
nine feet six inches in girth, in September, 1796,
and is supposed to have been planted about 1684.
Sir T. Dick Lauder says it is probably the oldest
Walnut tree in Scotland, and is evidently decaying,
though whether from accident or age is uncertain.</p>

<p>Collinson tells us of another, in his <i>History of
Somersetshire</i>, which he says grew in the Abbey
Church-yard, on the north side of St. Joseph's
Chapel. This was a miraculous Walnut tree, which
never budded forth before the feast of St. Barnabas
(that is, the 11th June), and on that very day shot
forth leaves and flourished like its usual species. It
is strange to say how much this tree was sought
after by the credulous, and though not an uncommon
Walnut, Queen Anne, King James, and many
of the nobility, even when the times of monkish
superstition had ceased, gave large sums of money
for small cuttings from the original.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">This</span> Pine is a native of North America, growing
in fertile soils, on the sides of hills, from Canada to
Virginia. It was introduced about 1705, and was
soon after planted in great quantities at Longleat,
in Wiltshire, the seat of Lord Weymouth, where the
trees prospered amazingly, and whence the species
received the name of the Weymouth Pine.</p>

<p>In America, in the state of Vermont, and near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
the commencement of the river St. Lawrence, this
tree is found one hundred and eighty feet in height,
with a straight trunk, from about four to seven
feet in diameter. The trunk is generally free from
branches for two-thirds or three-fourths of its height;
the branches are short, and in whorls, or disposed
in tiers one above another, nearly to the top, which
consists of three or four upright branches, forming
a small conical head. The bark, on young trees,
is smooth, and even polished; but as the tree
advances in age, it splits, and becomes rugged and
gray, but does not fall off in scales like that of
other Pines. The leaves are from three to four
inches long, straight, upright, slender, soft, triquetrous,
of a fine light bluish green, marked with silvery
longitudinal channels; scabrous and inconspicuously
serrated on the margin; spreading in
summer, but in winter contracted, and lying close
to the branches. The barren catkins are short,
elliptic, racemose, pale purple, mixed with yellow,
and turning red before they fall. The fertile catkins
are ovate-cylindrical; erect, on short peduncles
when young, but when full-grown pendulous,
and from four to six inches long, slightly curved,
and composed of thin smooth scales, rounded at
the base, and partly covered with white resin, particularly
on the tips of the scales; apex of the
scales thick, and seeds oval, of a dull gray. The
cones open to shed the seeds in October of the
second year.</p>

<p>Gilpin is very severe upon this tree, and says
that it has very little picturesque beauty to recommend
it. On the contrary, this tree seems to be a
great addition to a landscape: the meagreness of
foliage, which Gilpin considers one of its principal
defects, giving to it, in our opinion, an elegant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
appearance. He says that it is admired for its
polished bark; but he adds, the painter's eye pays
little attention to so trivial a circumstance, even
when the tree is considered as a single object. Its
stem rises with perpendicular exactness; it rarely
varies, and its branches issue with equal formality
from its sides. Opposed to the wildness of other
trees, the regularity of the Weymouth Pine has
sometimes its beauty. A few of its branches hanging
from a mass of heavier foliage, may appear
light and feathery, while its spiry head may often
form an agreeable apex to a clump.</p>

<p>The Weymouth Pine is propagated from seed,
which come up the first year, and may be treated
like those of the Scotch fir. The rate of growth,
except in good soil and in very favourable situations,
is slower than that of most European Pines.
Nevertheless, in the climate of London, it will
attain the height of twelve feet in ten years from
the seed. The wood is white or very palish yellow,
of a fine grain, soft, light, free from knots, and
easily wrought; it is also durable, and not very
liable to split when exposed to the sun: but it has
little strength, gives a feeble hold to nails, and
sometimes swells from the humidity of the atmosphere;
while, from the very great diminution of
the trunk from the base to the summit, it is difficult
to procure planks of any great length and
uniform diameter. The largest Weymouth Pine
in this country is at Kingston, in Somersetshire.
In 1837 this tree was ninety-five feet in height,
with a trunk of three feet in diameter.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Whitebeam tree is a native of most parts of
Europe, from Norway to the Mediterranean Sea;
and also of Siberia and Western Asia. It is to be
met with in every part of Britain, varying greatly
in magnitude, according to soil and situation. It
seems to prefer chalky soils, or limestone rocks;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and also, according to Withering, loves dry hills
and open exposures, and nourishes either on gravel
or clay. The Whitebeam rises to the height of
forty or fifty feet, with a straight, erect, smooth
trunk, and numerous branches, which for the most
part tend upwards, and form a round or oval head.
The young shoots have a brown bark, covered with
a mealy down. The leaves are between two and
three inches long, and one and a half broad in the
middle, oval, light green above, and very white
and downy beneath. The flowers, which appear
in May, are terminal, in large corymbs, two inches
or more in diameter, and they are succeeded by
scarlet fruit.</p>

<p>Mr. Loudon says that, "as an ornamental tree,
the Whitebeam has some valuable properties. It
is of a moderate size, and of a definite shape; and
thus, bearing a character of art, it is adapted for
particular situations, near works of art, where the
violent contrast exhibited by trees of picturesque
forms would be inharmonious. In summer, when
clothed with leaves, it forms a compact green
mass, till it is ruffled by the wind, when it suddenly
assumes a mealy whiteness. In the winter
season, the tree is attractive from its smooth
branches and its large green buds; which, from
their size and colour, seem already prepared for
spring, and remind us of the approach of that delightful
season. When the tree is covered with its
fruit, it is exceedingly ornamental."</p>

<span class="figcaption">Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit of <i>P. avium</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The Whitebeam may be raised from seed, which
should be sown as soon as the fruit is ripe; otherwise,
if kept till spring, and then sown, they will
not come up till the spring following. The varieties
may be propagated by cuttings, or by layering;
but they root, by both modes, with great difficulty.
Layers require to be made of the young wood, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to remain attached to the stool for two years. The
rate of growth, when the tree is young, and in a
good soil, is from eighteen to twenty-four inches
a year: after it has attained the height of fifteen or
twenty feet it grows much slower; but it is a tree
of great duration. The roots descend very deep,
and spread very wide; and the head of the tree is
less affected by prevailing winds than almost any
other. In the most exposed situations, on the
Highland mountains, this tree is seldom seen above
ten or fifteen feet high; but it is always stiff and
erect. It bears lopping, and permits the grass to
grow under it.</p>

<p>The wood is hard and tough, and of a very close
grain, and will take a very high polish. It is much
used for knife handles, wooden spoons, axle-trees,
walking-sticks, and tool-handles. Its principal
use, however, is for cogs for wheels in machinery.</p>

<p>The Cherry, in a wild state, is indigenous in Central
Europe, and is also found in Russia up to
56° N. lat. In England, it is met with in woods
and hedges; and is found apparently wild in Scotland
and Ireland.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Wild Cherry has grown in this country
from fifty to eighty-five feet in height. In cultivation,
whether in woods or gardens, it may, in point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of general appearance, be included in these forms:&mdash;Large
trees with stout branches, and shoots proceeding
from the main stem, nearly horizontally;
fastigiate trees, or with the branches appressed to
the stem, of a smaller size; and small trees with
weak wood, and branches divergent and drooping.
The leaves vary so much in the cultivated varieties,
that it is impossible to characterise the sorts
by them; but, in general, those of the large trees
are largest, and the lightest in colour, and those
of the slender-branched trees the smallest, and the
darkest in colour; the flowers are also largest on
the large trees. The specific characters of the
Wild Black Cherry may be thus stated:&mdash;Leaves
drooping, oblong, obovate, pointed, serrated, somewhat
pendant, slightly pubescent on the under side,
furnished with two glands at the base, and downy
beneath. Flowers white, in nearly sessile umbels,
not numerous. The colour of the fruit is a very
deep, dark red, or black; the flesh is of the same
colour, small in quantity, austere and bitter before
it comes to maturity, and insipid when the fruit is
perfectly ripe. The nut is oval or ovate, like the
fruit, firmly adhering to the flesh, and very large
in proportion to the fruit. The juice is mostly
coloured: and the skin does not separate from the
flesh.</p>

<p>As a tree, the Wild Cherry is not only valuable
for its timber, but for the food which it supplies
to birds, by increasing the number of which, the
insects which attack trees of every kind are materially
kept down. This is one reason why Cherry
trees are generally encouraged in the forests of
France and Belgium: an additional reason, in
Britain, is the nourishment which they afford to
singing birds, particularly to the blackbird and
thrush, and while any are to be found on the trees,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
they may be said to convert them into musical
bowers. As an ornamental tree it is also worth
cultivating, as it produces a profusion of flowers
from an early age, and at an early period of the
year; these from their snowy whiteness, contrast
well with the blossom of the almond and the
scarlet thorn. Its foliage is also handsome, though
rather too uniform and unbroken to produce picturesque
effect; in the autumn, when it assumes
a deep purplish-red colour, it gives a great richness
to the landscape, and contrasts well with the yellows
and browns which predominate at that season.</p>

<p>The Wild Cherry is also recommended for the
copse, because it produces a strong shoot, and will
shoot forth from the roots as the elm, especially
if you fell lusty trees. In light ground it will increase
to a goodly tall tree, of which some have
been known to attain the height of more than
eighty-five feet. Sir T. D. Lauder says, "It may
very well be called a forest-tree, seeing that in
many parts of Scotland it is almost as numerous,
and propagates itself as fast as the birch; it grows,
moreover, to be a very handsome timber-tree, and
the wood of it makes very pretty furniture. In
form, it is oftener graceful than grand; and its
foliage is rather too sparse to produce that tufty
effect which gives breadth of light and depth of
shadow enough to please the painter's eye. But
on the cliffs of romantic rivers, such as the Findhorn,
and other Scottish streams of the same character,
where it is stinted of soil, it often shoots from
the crevices of the rocks in very picturesque forms;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and the scarlet of its autumnal tint, when not in
excess, sometimes produces very brilliant touches
in the landscape, when the neighbouring trees
happen to be in harmony with it;" and if "merely
considered as a natural object, nothing can be
more splendid than its appearance when covered
with a full blow of flowers in spring, or more gorgeous
than the hue of its autumnal livery."</p>

<p>"The Cherry has always been a favourite tree
with poets; the brilliant red of the fruit, the
whiteness and profusion of the blossoms, and the
vigorous growth of the tree, affording abundant
similies. At Ely, in Cambridgeshire, when the
cherries are ripe, numbers of people repair, on
what they call Cherry Sunday, to the cherry orchards
in the neighbourhood; where, on the payment
of 6<i>d.</i> each, they are allowed to eat as many
cherries as they choose. A similar fète is held at
Montmorency, in France. A festival is also celebrated
annually at Hamburg, called the Feast of
the Cherries, during which troops of children
parade the streets with green boughs, ornamented
with cherries. The original of this fète is said to
be as follows:&mdash;In 1432, when the city of Hamburg
was besieged by the Hussites, one of the
citizens, named Wolf, proposed that all the children
in the city, between seven and fourteen
years of age, should be clad in mourning, and
sent as suppliants to the enemy. Procopius Nasus,
chief of the Hussites, was so much moved by this
spectacle, that he not only promised to spare the
city, but regaled the young suppliants with cherries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and other fruits; and the children returned
crowned with leaves, shouting 'Victory!' and holding
boughs laden with cherries in their hands."&mdash;<i>Loudon.</i></p>

<p>The Common Wild Cherry is almost always
raised from seed; but, as the roots throw up
suckers in great abundance, these suckers might
be employed for the same purpose. When plants
are to be raised from seed, the cherries should be
gathered when fully ripe and sown immediately
with the flesh on, and covered with about an inch
of light mould. The strongest plants, at the end
of the next season, will be about eighteen inches
in height; these may be drawn out from among
the smaller plants, and transplanted into nursery
rows, from whence they will, in another season,
be fit to be transferred to the plantations, or to be
grafted or budded. It will grow in any soil or
situation, neither too wet nor entirely a strong
clay. It stands less in need of shelter than any
other fruit-bearing tree whatever, and for surrounding
kitchen gardens, to form a screen against high
winds. Dr. Withering observes that it thrives
best when unmixed with other trees; that it bears
pruning, and suffers the grass to grow under it.</p>

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Common Wild Service-tree is a native of
various parts of Europe, from Germany to the
Mediterranean, and of the south of Russia, and
Western Asia. It is found in woods and hedges in
the middle and south of England, but not in Scotland
or Ireland. It generally grows in strong
clayey soils.</p>

<p>This tree grows to the height of forty or fifty
feet, spreading at the top into many branches,
and forming a large head. The branches are well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
clad with leaves, and are covered when young with
a purplish bark, with white spots. The leaves are
on pretty long foot-stalks, and are nearly four
inches in length and three in breadth in the
middle, simple, somewhat cordate, serrate, seven-lobed,
bright green on the upper side, and woolly
underneath. The flowers are white, in large, terminal,
downy panicles; they appear in May, and
are succeeded by roundish compressed fruit, similar
in appearance to large haws, and ripen late
in autumn, when they are brown. If kept till
they are soft, in the same way as medlars, they
have an agreeable acid flavour.</p>

<p>The Service-tree gives the husbandman an early
presage of the approaching spring, by putting forth
its adorned buds; and it ventures to peep out even
in the severest seasons. As an ornamental tree,
its large green buds strongly recommend it in the
winter and spring; as its fine large-lobed leaves do
in summer, and its large and numerous clusters of
rich brown fruit do in autumn.</p>

<span class="figcaption">Leaves, Flowers, and Fruit of <i>P. torminalis</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The best mode of propagating the Service-tree
is by suckers. Of these it puts forth a goodly
number: and it may also be budded with great
improvement. It prospers best in good stiff ground,
of a nature rather cold than hot; for where the
soil is too dry, it will not yield well. This tree
may either be grafted on itself, or on the white
thorn and quince. To this may be added the
Mespilus, or medlar, being a very hard wood, and
of which very beautiful walking-sticks are sometimes
made. The timber of the Service-tree is
useful for the joiner, and it has occasionally been
used for wainscoting rooms. It is also used for
bows, pulleys, screws, mill and other spindles; for
goads to drive oxen with; for pistol and gun-stocks;
and for most of the purposes for which the wild
pear-tree is serviceable. It is valued by the turner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
in the manufacture of various curiosities, having a
very delicate grain, which makes a showy appearance;
and it is very durable. When rubbed over
with well-boiled linseed oil, it is an admirable
imitation of ebony, or almost any Indian wood.</p>

<p>One of the finest specimens of the Service-tree
in England is said to be at Arley Hall, near
Bewdley. This tree is fifty-four feet six inches
high; the diameter of the trunk, at a foot from
the ground, is three feet six inches; and that of
the head is fifty-eight feet eight inches.</p>

</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Willows are chiefly natives of the colder parts
of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere.
More than two hundred species of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
genus have been described by botanists, of which
sixty-six are considered indigenous in this country.
These are subdivided into scientific and economic
groups. The economic groups are:&mdash;for growing
as timber-trees, for coppice-wood, for hoops, for
basket-rods, for hedges, and for ornamental trees
or shrubs.</p>

<p>The Babylonian or Weeping Willow, <i>S. Babylonica</i>,
the portrait of which heads this article, is the most
picturesque and beautiful tree of this genus. It
is a native of Asia, on the banks of the Euphrates,
near Babylon, whence its name; and also of China,
and other parts of Asia; and of Egypt, and other
parts of the north of Africa. It is said to have
been introduced into England by the poet Pope,
who planted it in his garden at Twickenham, where
it was known until about 1800 as "Pope's Willow;"
but it was more probably brought to Europe by
the botanist Tournefort, before 1700. Of the
Weeping Willow, Miller says, "It grows to a considerable
size. I have one in my view whilst I am
writing, which is four and a half feet in circumference
at three feet above the ground, and is at least
thirty feet in height; the age is thirty-four years.
This tree is remarkable, and generally esteemed for
its long slender pendulous branches, which give it
a peculiar character, and render it a beautiful object
on the margin of streams or pools. The leaves
are minutely and sharply serrate, smooth on both
sides, glaucous underneath, with the midrib whitish;
on short petioles. Stipules, when present,
roundish or semilunar, and very small; but more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
frequently wanting, and then in their stead a glandular
dot on each side. Catkins axillary, small,
oblong; in the barren the filaments longer than the
scale, with two ovate erect glands fastened to the
base; the fertile on two-leafed peduncles, scarcely
longer than half an inch."</p>

<p>The light airy spray of the Weeping Willow is
pendent. The shape of its leaf is conformable to
the pensile character of the tree; and its spray,
which is lighter than that of the poplar, is more
easily put into motion by a breath of air. The
Weeping Willow, however, is not adapted to sublime
subjects; but the associations which are
awakened in conjunction with it, by that very
beautiful psalm, "By the waters of Babylon we
sat down and wept, when we remembered thee, O
Sion! as for our harps, we hanged them up upon
the Willows,"&mdash;are of themselves sufficient to impart
to it an interest in every human breast touched
by the sublime strains of the Psalmist.</p>

<p class="poem">
On the Willow thy harp is suspended,<br />
O Salem! its sound shall be free;<br />
And the hour when thy glories were ended,<br />
But left me that token of thee.<br />
And ne'er shall its soft notes be blended,<br />
With the voice of the spoiler by me.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 16em;"><span class="smcap">Byron</span>.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Gilpin says we do not employ the Willow to screen
the broken buttresses and Gothic windows of an
abbey, nor to overshadow the battlements of a
ruined castle. These offices it resigns to the oak,
whose dignity can support them. The Weeping
Willow seeks a humbler scene&mdash;some romantic foot-path
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
bridge, which it half conceals, or some glassy
pool, over which it hangs its streaming foliage,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">&mdash;and dips</span><br />
Its pendent boughs, stooping, as if to drink.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">In these situations it appears in character, and to
advantage.</p>

<p>No poet ever mentions the Weeping Willow but
in connection with sad and melancholy thoughts.
Burns, in his "Braes of Yarrow," thus sings:</p>

<p class="poem">
Take off, take off these bridal weeds,<br />
And crown my careful head with Willow.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Prior alludes to the afflicted daughters of Israel:</p>

<p class="poem">
Afflicted Israel shall sit weeping down,<br />
Their harps upon the neighbouring Willows hung.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And Dr. Booker refers to the same pathetic scene:</p>

<p class="poem">
Silent their harps (each cord unstrung)<br />
On pendent Willow branches hung.<br />
</p>

<p>The Willow is generally found growing on the
borders of small streams or rivers. The Sacred
writers almost constantly refer to this natural
habit. Thus in Job we read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The shady trees cover him with their shadows; the Willows
of the brook compass him about (xl. 22).</p></div>

<p>And again, Isaiah, in two places, speaks of its connection
with the brook:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the
brook of the Willows (xv. 7).</p>

<p>They shall spring up as among the grass, as Willows by the
water-courses (xliv. 4).</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p class="p0">And Ezekiel refers to this habit of the Willow:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He took also of the seed of the land, and placed it by great
waters, and set it as a Willow-tree (xvii. 5).</p></div>

<p class="p0">And in referring to profane authors, we find Milton
speaking of</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">&mdash;the rushy-fringed bank</span><br />
Where grows the Willow.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">An anonymous writer, too, mentions</p>

<p class="poem">
The thirsty Salix bending o'er the stream,<br />
Its boughs as banners waving to the breeze.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">The pastoral poet Rowe places his despairing Shepherd
under Silken Willows. Thus he sings&mdash;(we
will give the chorus in the first verse, and not repeat
it, as it would occupy too much space):</p>

<p class="poem">
To the brook and the Willow that heard him complain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ah, Willow, Willow;</span><br />
Poor Colin sat weeping, and told them his pain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ah, Willow, Willow; ah, Willow, Willow.</span><br />
<br />
Sweet stream, he cry'd sadly, I'll teach thee to flow,<br />
And the waters shall rise to the brink with my woe.<br />
<br />
All restless and painful poor Amoret lies,<br />
And counts the sad moments of time as it flies.<br />
<br />
To the nymph my heart loves, ye soft slumbers repair,<br />
Spread your downy wings o'er her, and make her your care.<br />
<br />
Dear brook, were thy chance near her pillow to creep,<br />
Perhaps thy soft murmurs might lull her to sleep.<br />
<br />
Let me be kept waking, my eyes never close,<br />
So the sleep that I lose brings my fair-one repose.<br />
<br />
But if I am doom'd to be wretched indeed;<br />
If the loss of my dear-one, my love is decreed;<br />
<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
If no more my sad heart by those eyes shall be cheered;<br />
If the voice of my warbler no more shall be heard;<br />
<br />
Believe me, thou fair-one; thou dear-one believe,<br />
Few sighs to thy loss, and few tears will I give.<br />
<br />
One fate to thy Colin and thee shall be ty'd,<br />
And soon lay thy shepherd close by thy cold side.<br />
<br />
Then run, gentle brook; and to lose thyself, haste;<br />
Fade thou, too, my Willow; this verse is my last.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Chatterton, in one of his songs, has the following
lines:</p>

<p class="poem">

</p>

<p class="p0">In Ovid we read of</p>

<p class="p0">Shakspeare introduces it in Hamlet, where he describes
the place of Ophelia's death:</p>

<p class="poem">
There is a Willow grows ascant the brook,<br />

There with fantastic garlands did she make,<br />
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,<br />
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br />
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:<br />
There on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds<br />
Clambering to hang, an envious silver broke;<br />
When down her weedy trophies and herself<br />
Fell in the weeping brook.<br />

<p>The Willows that attain the size of trees of the
first and second rank, and that produce valuable
timber, are the four following:&mdash;The Crack Willow,
the Russell Willow, the Huntingdon Willow, and
the Goat Willow.</p>

<span class="figcaption">Leaves and Catkins of <i>S. fragilis</i>.</span>
</div>

<p>The Crack or Red-wood Willow, <i>S. fragilis</i>, is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
tall bushy tree, sometimes growing from eighty to
ninety feet in height, with the branches set on
obliquely, somewhat crossing each other, not continued
in a straight line outwards from the trunk;
by which character it may be readily distinguished
even in winter. The branches are round, very
smooth, "and so brittle at the base, in spring, that
with the slightest blow they start from the trunk,"
whence the name of Crack Willow. Its leaves
are ovate-lanceolate, pointed, serrated throughout,
very glabrous. Foot-stalks glandular, ovary ovate,
abrupt, nearly sessile, glabrous. Bracts oblong,
about equal to the stamens and pistils. Stigmas
cloven, longer than the style.</p>

<p>The Russell or Bedford Willow, <i>S. Russelliana</i>,
is frequently found from eighty to ninety feet in
height. It is more handsome than <i>S. fragilis</i> in its
mode of growth, as well as altogether of a lighter
or brighter hue. The branches are long, straight,
and slender, not angular in their insertion, like
those of <i>S. fragilis</i>. The leaves are lanceolate,
tapering at each end, serrated throughout, and very
glabrous. Foot-stalks, glandular or leafy. Ovary
tapering; stalked, longer than the bracts. Style
as long as the stigma. Dr. Johnson's favourite
Willow, at Lichfield, was of this species. In 1781,
the trunk of this tree rose to the height of nearly
nine feet, and then divided into fifteen large ascending
branches, which, in any numerous and crowded
subdivisions, spread at the top in a circular form,
not unlike the appearance of a shady oak, inclining
a little towards the east. The circumference of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
trunk at the bottom was nearly sixteen feet; in the
middle about twelve feet; and thirteen feet at the
top, immediately below the branches. The entire
height of the tree was forty-nine feet; and the
circumference of the branches, at their extremities,
upwards of two hundred feet, overshadowing a plane
not far short of four thousand feet. This species
was first brought into notice for its valuable properties
as a timber-tree, by the late Duke of Bedford;
whence its name.</p>

<p>The Huntingdon, or Common White Willow,
<i>S. alba</i>, grows rapidly, attaining the height of
thirty feet in twelve years, and rising to sixty feet
in height, or upwards, even in inferior soils; while,
in favourable situations, it will reach the height
of eighty feet, or upwards. "The bark is thick
and full of cracks. The branches are numerous,
spreading widely, silky when young. The leaves
are all alternate, on shortish foot-stalks, lanceolate,
broadest a little above the middle, pointed, tapering
towards each end, regularly and acutely serrated,
the lowest serrature most glandular; both sides of
a grayish, somewhat glaucous, green, beautifully
silky, with close-pressed silvery hairs, very dense
and brilliant on the uppermost, or youngest leaves;
the lowermost on each branch, like the bracts, are
smaller, more obtuse, and greener. Stipules variable,
either roundish or oblong, small, often wanting.
Catkins on short stalks, with three or four
spreading bracts, for the most part coming from
the leaves, but a few more often appear after midsummer;
they are all cylindrical, rather slender,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
obtuse, near one and a half inch long. Scales
fringed, rounded at the end; those of the barren
catkins narrower towards the base; of the fertile,
dilated and convolute in that part. Two obtuse
glands, one before, the other behind the stamens.
Filaments hairy in their lower part. Anthers
roundish, yellow. Ovary very nearly sessile, green,
smooth, ovate, lanceolate, bluntish, longer than
the scale. Style short. Stigmas short, thickish,
cloven. Capsule ovate, brown, smooth, rather small."</p>

<p>The Goat Willow, Large-leafed Sallow, or Saugh,
<i>S. caprea</i>, is distinguished from all the other Willows
by its large ovate, or sometimes orbicular
ovate leaves, which are pointed, serrated, and
waved on the margin; beneath they are of a pale
glaucous colour, and clothed with down, but dark
green above; varying in length from two to three
inches. Foot-stalks stout, downy. Stipules crescent-shaped.
Capsules lanceolate, swelling. Style
very short. Buds glabrous. Catkins very thick,
oval, numerous, nearly sessile, expanding much
earlier than the foliage. The ovary is stalked,
silky, and ovate in form; the stigmas are undivided,
and nearly sessile. In favourable situations this
tree attains a height of from thirty to forty feet,
with a trunk from one to two feet in diameter. It
seldom, however, possesses any considerable length
of clean stem, as the branches which form the
head generally begin to divide at a moderate
height, and diverging in different directions, give
it the bearing and appearance of a compact, round-headed
tree. It grows in almost all soils and situations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
but prefers dry loams, and in such attains
its greatest size.</p>

<p>There are very few existing Willow-trees remarkable
for age or size. The one most worthy
of note is the Abbot's Willow, at Bury St. Edmunds.
It grows on the banks of the Lark, a small river
running through the park of John Benjafield, Esq.
It is seventy-five feet in height, and the stem is
eighteen feet and a half in girth; it then divides
in a very picturesque manner into two large limbs,
one fifteen and the other twelve feet in girth. It
shadows an area of ground two hundred and four
feet in diameter, and the tree contains four hundred
and forty feet of solid timber.</p>

<p>The uses of the Willow are perhaps equal to
those of any other species of our native trees; it is
remarked that it supports the banks of rivers, dries
marshy soil, supplies bands or withies, feeds a great
variety of insects, rejoices bees, yields abundance
of fine wood, affords nourishment to cattle with its
leaves, and yields a substitute for Jesuit's bark; to
which Evelyn adds, all kinds of basket-work, pillboxes,
cart saddle-trees, gun-stocks, and half-pikes,
harrows, shoemakers' lasts, forks, rakes, ladders,
poles for hop vines, small casks and vessels, especially
to preserve verjuice in. To which may be
added cricket-bats, and numerous other articles
where lightness and toughness of wood are desirable.
The wood of the Willow has also the property
of whetting knives like a whetstone; therefore
all knife-boards should be made of this tree in
preference to any other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>From the earliest times, the various species of
Willow have been made use of by man for forming
articles of utility; but as an account of our principal
forest-trees is the object of this work, it would
be out of place to describe those species which
are cultivated for coppice-wood, hoops, basket-rods,
or hedges. We may, however, remark that
the shields of the ancients were made of wicker
work, covered with ox-hides; that the ancient
Britons served up their meats in osier baskets or
dishes, and that these articles were greatly admired
by the Romans.</p>

<p class="poem">
A basket I by painted Britons wrought,<br />
And now to Rome's imperial city brought.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And for want of proper tools for sawing trees into
planks, the Britons and other savages made boats
of osiers covered with skins, in which they braved
the ocean in quest of plunder:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
The bending Willow into barks they twined,<br />
Then lined the work with spoils of slaughtered kind;<br />
Such are the floats Venetian fishers know,<br />
Where in dull marshes stands the settling Po,<br />
On such to neighbouring Gaul, allured by gain,<br />
The bolder Briton crossed the swelling main.<br />

<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> Berried or Common Yew is indigenous to
most parts of Europe, from 58° N. lat. to the
Mediterranean Sea; also to the east and west of
Asia; and of North America. It is found in
every part of Britain, and also in Ireland: on
limestone cliffs, and in mountainous woods, in the
south of England; on schistose, basaltic, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
other rocks, in the north of England: and in
Scotland, it is particularly abundant on the north
side of the mountains near Loch Lomond. In
Ireland, it grows in the crevices of rocks, at an
elevation of 1200 feet above the level of the sea;
but at that height it assumes the appearance of a
low shrub. The Yew is rather a solitary than a
social tree; being generally found either alone or
with trees of a different species.</p>

<p>The Yew-tree rises from the ground with a
short but straight trunk, which sends out, at the
height of three or four feet, numerous branches,
spreading out nearly horizontally, and forms a
head of dense foliage. When full-grown it attains
the height of from thirty to fifty feet. The trunk
and bark are channelled longitudinally, and are
generally rough, from the protruding remains of
shoots which have decayed and dropped off. The
bark is smooth, thin, of a brown colour, and scales
off like the pine. The branches are thickly clad
with leaves, which are two-rowed, crowded, naked,
linear, entire, very slightly revolute, and about
one inch long; very dark green, smooth, and
shining above; paler, with a prominent midrib,
beneath; terminating in a point. The flowers,
which appear in May, are solitary, proceeding
from a scaly axillary bud; those of the barren
plant are pale brown, and discharge a very abundant
yellowish white pollen. The fertile flowers
are green, and in form not unlike a young acorn.
Fruit drooping, consisting of a sweet, internally
glutinous, scarlet berry, open at the top, inclosing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
a brown oval nut, unconnected with the fleshy
part. The kernels of these nuts are not deleterious,
as supposed by many, but may be eaten, and
they possess a sweet and agreeable nutty flavour.</p>

<p>Of all trees the Yew is the most tonsile. Hence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
all the indignities it formerly suffered. Everywhere
it was cut and metamorphosed into such a variety
of deformities, that we could hardly conceive that
it had any natural shape, or the power which other
trees possess, of hanging carelessly and negligently.
Yet it has this power in a very eminent degree;
and in a state of nature, except in exposed situations,
is perhaps one of the most beautiful evergreens
we have. It is now, however, seldom found
in a state of perfection. Not ranking among timber-trees,
it is thus in a degree unprivileged, and
unprotected by forest laws, and has often been
made booty of by those who durst not lay violent
hands on the oak or the ash. But still, in many
parts of the New Forest, some noble specimens of
it are left. There is one which was esteemed by
Gilpin to be a tree of peculiar beauty. It immediately
divides into several massy limbs, each of
which, hanging in grand loose foliage, spreads
over a large compass of ground, and yet the whole
tree forms a close compact body; that is, its boughs
are not so separated as to break into distinct parts.
It is not equal in size to the Yew at Fotheringal,
near Taymouth, in Scotland, which measures fifty-six
and a half feet in circumference, nor to many
others on record; but is of sufficient size for all
the purposes of landscape, and is in point of picturesque
beauty probably equal to any of them.
It stands near the left bank of Lymington river,
as you look towards the sea, between Roydon
Farm and Boldre Church.</p>

<p>So long as the taste prevailed for metamorphosing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the Yew into obelisks, pyramids, birds, and
beasts, it was very commonly planted near houses.
Now it is nearly banished from the precincts of
our residences and pleasure-grounds; not, it would
appear, from any real objection that can be urged
either against its form or the effect it produces,
but from now considering it as a funereal tree, and
associating it with scenes of melancholy and the
grave, a feeling doubtless arising from many of our
most venerable and celebrated specimens growing
in ancient church-yards. The origin of these
locations is now considered to have arisen from
churches having been erected on the sites of
Druidical places of worship in Yew groves, or near
old Yew-trees. Hence the planting of Yews in
church-yards is a custom of heathen origin, which
was ingrafted on Christianity on its introduction
into Britain.</p>

<p>The sepulchral character of the Yew is thus referred
to by Sir Walter Scott, in <i>Rokeby</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
But here 'twixt rock and river grew<br />
A dismal grove of sable Yew.<br />
With whose sad tints were mingled seen<br />
The blighted fir's sepulchral green.<br />
Seemed that the trees their shadows cast,<br />
The earth that nourished them to blast;<br />
For never knew that swathy grove<br />
The verdant hue that fairies love,<br />
Nor wilding green, nor woodland flower,<br />
Arose within its baleful bower.<br />
The dank and sable earth receives<br />
Its only carpet from the leaves,<br />
That, from the withering branches cast,<br />
Bestrewed the ground with every blast.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">And Kirke White, in a fragment written in Wilford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
church-yard, near Nottingham, on occasion of
his recovering from sickness, thus introduces it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Here would I wish to sleep.&mdash;This is the spot<br />
Which I have long marked out to lay my bones in;<br />
Tired out and wearied with the riotous world,<br />
Beneath this Yew I would be sepulchred.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">While in that beautiful and pathetic Elegy of Gray's,
which is familiar to every mind in Britain, we
read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Beneath&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;that Yew-tree's shade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,</span><br />
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Poor Carrington has the following lines on the
Yew-tree, in a poem entitled <i>My Native Village</i>.
The author is buried in the little quiet church-yard
of Combehay, a sequestered village at a short distance
from Bath. It is situated in a deep and
unfrequented valley, where some of the finest and
most luxuriant scenery in the west of England
may be found. It was chosen, his son tells us,
because it is a spot which, when living, he would
have loved full well:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Tree of the days of old&mdash;time-honour'd Yew!<br />
Pride of my boyhood&mdash;manhood&mdash;age, Adieu!<br />
Broad was thy shadow, mighty one, but now<br />
Sits desolation on thy leafless bough!<br />
That huge and far-fam'd trunk, scoop'd out by age,<br />
Will break, full soon, beneath the tempest's rage:<br />
Few are the leaves lone sprinkled o'er thy breast,<br />
There's bleakness, blackness on thy shiver'd crest!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
When Spring shall vivify again the earth,<br />
And yon blest vale shall ring with woodland mirth,<br />
Morning, noon, eve,&mdash;no bird with wanton glee<br />
Shall pour anew his poetry from thee;<br />
For thou hast lost thy greenness, and he loves<br />
The verdure and companionship of groves&mdash;<br />
Sings where the song is loudest, and the spray,<br />
Fresh, fair, and youthful, dances in the ray!<br />
Nor shall returning Spring, o'er storms and strife<br />
Victorious, e'er recal thee into life!<br />
Yet stand thou there&mdash;majestic to the last,<br />
And stoop with grandeur to the conquering blast.<br />
Aye, stand thou there&mdash;for great in thy decay,<br />
Thou wondrous remnant of a far-gone day,<br />
Thy name, thy might, shall wake in rural song,<br />
Bless'd by the old&mdash;respected by the young;<br />
While all unknown, uncar'd for,&mdash;oak on oak<br />
Of yon tall grove shall feel the woodman's stroke;<br />
One common, early fate awaits them all,<br />
No sympathizing eye shall mark their fall;<br />
And beautiful in ruin as they lie,<br />
For them shall not be heard one rustic sigh!<br />
</p>

<p>Since the use of the bow has been superseded
by more deadly instruments of warfare, the cultivation
of the Yew is now less common. This, says
Evelyn, is to be deplored; for the barrenest ground
and coldest of our mountains might be profitably
replenished with them. However, in winter, we
may still see some of the higher hills in Surrey
clad with entire woods of Yew and cypress, for
miles around, as we stand on Box Hill; and might,
without any violence to the ordinary powers of
imagination, fancy ourselves transported into a
new or enchanted country. Indeed, Evelyn remarked,
in his day, that if in any spot in England,</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 11em;">&mdash;'tis here</span><br />
Eternal spring and summer all the year.<br />
</p>

<p class="p0">Our venerable author records a Yew-tree, ten yards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in girth, which grew in the church-yard of Crowhurst,
in the county of Surrey. And another standing
in Braburne church-yard, near Scot's Hall,
Kent; which being fifty-eight feet eleven inches
in circumference, would be near 20 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>There are several remarkable existing church-yard
Yews in this country. The tallest, which is
at Harlington, near Hounslow, is fifty-six feet
in height; another at Martley, Worcestershire, is
about twelve yards in circumference; and at Ashill,
Somersetshire, there are two very large trees&mdash;one
fifteen feet round, extending its branches
north and south fifty-six feet; the other dividing
into three large trunks a little above the ground,
but having many of its branches decayed. There are
also eleven Yew-trees in the church-yard of Aberystwith,
the largest being twenty-four feet, and the
smallest eleven feet six inches, in circumference.</p>

<p>There is also a group of Yews at Fountain's
Abbey worthy of remark on their own account,
and they are also interesting in a historical view.
Burton gives the following notice of them:&mdash;"At
Christmas the Archbishop, being at Ripon (anno
1132), assigned to the monks some lands in the
patrimony of St. Peter, about three miles west of
that place, for the erecting of a monastery. The
spot of ground had never been inhabited, unless
by wild beasts, being overgrown with wood and
brambles, lying between two steep hills and rocks,
covered with wood on all sides, more proper for a
retreat for wild beasts than the human species.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
This was called Skeldale, or the vale of the Skell,
a rivulet running through it from the west to the
eastward part of it. The Archbishop also gave to
them a neighbouring village, called Sutton Richard.
The prior of St. Mary's, at York, was chosen abbot
by the monks, being the first of this monastery of
Fountain's, with whom they withdrew into this uncouth
desert, without any house to shelter them in
the winter season, or provisions to subsist on; but
entirely depending on Divine Providence. There
stood a large elm in the midst of the vale, on which
they put some thatch or straw, and under that they
lay, eat, and prayed, the bishop for a time supplying
them with bread, and the rivulet with drink.
Part of the day some spent in making wattles, to
erect a little oratory, whilst others cleared some
ground, to make a little garden. But it is supposed
that they soon changed the shelter of the elm
for that of seven Yew-trees, growing on the declivity
of the hill, on the south side of the Abbey, all
standing at this present time, except the largest,
which was blown down about the middle of the last
century. They are of extraordinary size; the
trunk of one of them is twenty-six feet six inches
in circumference, at the height of three feet from
the ground; and they stand so near each other, as
to form a cover almost equal to a thatched roof.
Under these trees, we are told by tradition, the
monks resided till they built the monastery, which
seems to be very probable, when we consider how
little a Yew-tree increases in a year, and to what
a bulk these are grown. And as the hill-side was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
covered with wood, which is now cut down, except
these trees, it seems as if they were left standing
to perpetuate the memory of the monks' habitation
there, during the first winter of their residence."</p>

<p>Wordsworth gives us the following animated description
of a noted Yew in Lorton Vale; and also
of four others&mdash;the "fraternal four,"&mdash;growing in
Borrowdale:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
There is a Yew-tree, pride of Lorton Vale,<br />
Which to this day stands single, in the midst<br />
Of its own darkness, as it stood of yore,<br />
Nor loth to furnish weapons for the bands<br />
Of Omfraville or Percy, ere they marched<br />
To Scotland's heath; or those that crossed the sea,<br />
And drew their sounding bows at Agincourt,<br />
Perhaps at earlier Crecy, or Poictiers.<br />
Of vast circumference and gloom profound<br />
This solitary tree! a living thing<br />
Produced too slowly ever to decay;<br />
Of form and aspect too magnificent<br />
To be destroyed. But worthier still of note<br />
Are these fraternal four of Borrowdale,<br />
Joined in one solemn and capacious grove;<br />
Huge trunks! and each particular trunk a growth<br />
Of intertwisted fibres serpentine<br />
Up-coiling, and inveterately convolved,&mdash;<br />
Nor uninformed with phantasy, and looks<br />
That threaten the profane;&mdash;a pillared shade<br />
Upon whose grassless floor of red-brown hue,<br />
By sheddings from the pining umbrage tinged<br />
Perennially&mdash;beneath whose sable roof<br />
Of boughs, as if for festal purpose, decked<br />
With unrejoicing berries, ghostly shapes<br />
May meet at moontide&mdash;Fear and trembling Hope,<br />
Silence and Foresight&mdash;Death the Skeleton,<br />
And Time the Shadow,&mdash;there to celebrate,<br />
As in a natural temple scattered o'er<br />
With altars undisturbed of mossy stone;<br />
United worship; or in mute repose<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
To lie, and listen to the mountain flood<br />
Murmuring from Glaramara's inmost caves.<br />
</p>

<p>The Yew is easily propagated by sowing the
berries as soon as they are ripe (without clearing
them from the surrounding pulp), upon a shady
bed of fresh soil, covering them over about half an
inch with the same earth. Many plants will
appear in spring, while others will remain in the
ground until autumn, or the spring following.
When the plants come up, they should be kept
free from weeds, or they will be choked and frequently
destroyed. The plants may remain in the
original bed two years, and then be removed early in
October into beds four or five feet wide, each plant
a foot apart from the next, and the same distance
in the rows; taking care to lay a little muck over
the ground about their roots, and to water them in
dry weather. There the plants may remain two or
three years, according to their growth, when they
should be transplanted into nursery rows at three
feet distance, and eighteen inches asunder. This
operation must be performed in autumn. After remaining
three or four years in the nursery, they
may be planted where they are to remain, observing
to remove them in autumn where the ground is
very dry, and in spring where it is cold and moist.
Whether as an evergreen undergrowth or as a
timber-tree, the Yew deserves to be more extensively,
cultivated than heretofore. As an underwood,
it is scarcely inferior to the holly, and only
so in failing to produce those sparkling effects of
light which distinguish the larger and more highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
glazed dark green foliage of that tree: in hardihood
it is its equal, and it bears, with the same
comparative impunity, the drip and shade of many
of our loftier deciduous trees, a quality of great importance
where an evergreen wood is desired. The
great value and durable properties of its wood
ought also to favour its introduction into our mixed
plantations, even where profit is the chief object in
view, the value of the wood well compensating for
the slowness of its growth. Besides, when fostered
by the shelter of surrounding trees, it would be
drawn up and grow much more rapidly, and with
a cleaner stem.</p>

<p>The Yew is not only celebrated for its toughness
and elasticity&mdash;it is a common saying among the
inhabitants of the New Forest, that a post of Yew
will outlast a post of iron. The veins of its timber
exceed in beauty those of most other trees, and its
roots are not surpassed by the ancient citron. The
artists in box most gladly employ it; and for the
cogs of mill-wheels and axle-trees, there is no wood
to be compared to it.</p>

<p>We extract the following table from the ancient
laws of Wales, showing the comparative worth of
a Yew with other trees:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
A consecrated Yew, its value is a pound.<br />
An oak, its value is six score pence.<br />
A mistletoe branch, its value is three score pence.<br />
Thirty pence is the value of every principal branch in the oak.<br />
Three score pence is the value of every sweet apple-tree.<br />
Thirty pence is the value of a sour apple-tree.<br />
Fifteen pence is the value of a good Yew-tree.<br />
Seven pence halfpenny is the value of a thorn-tree.<br />

<p class="caption2">FORESTS AND WOODLANDS</p>

<p class="caption3">OF</p>

<p class="caption2">GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.</p>


<p class="p0"><span class="smcap">The</span> British isles, like other countries of Europe, were in former
times abundantly covered with forests. The first general attack
made upon these in England was in 1536, when Henry VIII.
confiscated the church lands, and distributed them, together with
their woods, among numerous grantees. But it was not until
between the civil war which broke out in 1642 and the restoration
in 1660, that the royal forests, as well as the woods of the
nobility and gentry, were materially diminished. During these
few years, however, many extensive forests so completely disappeared,
that hardly any memorial was left of them but their
name. These two great territorial changes were followed by
increased social and national prosperity. Though we have now
hardly any forests or woodlands of considerable extent, there are
perhaps few countries over which timber is more equably distributed,
that is, in those counties where the soil and aspect are
favourable to its growth. Woods of small extent, coppices,
clumps, and clusters of trees are very generally distributed over
the face of the country, which, together with the timber scattered
in the hedge-rows, constitute a mass of wood of no inconsiderable
importance.</p>

<p>In Herefordshire, Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, and Staffordshire
is abundance of fine oak and elm woods. In Buckinghamshire
there is much birch and oak, and also fine beech.
Sussex, once celebrated for the extent and quality of its oak
forests, has yet some good timber; at present its woodlands,
including coppice-wood, occupy 175,000 acres. Essex, with
50,000 acres of woodland, has some elms and oaks. Surrey,
Hertfordshire, and Derbyshire abound in coppice-woods. In
Worcestershire is abundance of oak and elm. In Oxfordshire
there are the forests of Wychwood and Stokenchurch, chiefly of
beech, with some oak, ash, birch, and aspen. Berkshire contains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
a part of Windsor forest; and Gloucestershire, the Forest
of Dean; so that these three last counties are extensively wooded
and with noble trees. Cheshire has few woods of any extent,
but the hedge-row timber and coppices are in such abundance as
to give the whole country, especially when seen from an elevation,
the appearance of a vast forest. Of the remaining counties
some have very little wood, and a few are altogether without it;
but the want and value of timber have given rise to a great many
flourishing plantations. In Wales particularly, there is a rage
for planting. In South Wales alone six millions of trees, it is
said, are annually planted; if that is the case, nine-tenths of the
number must come to nothing, or the whole country would be
one entire forest.</p>

<p><i>Scotland</i> has few forests of large timber, if we except the
woods of Inverness-shire and Aberdeenshire. In the former of
these counties the natural pine-woods exceed the quantity of this
wood growing naturally in all the rest of Britain. In Strathspey
alone, there are 15,000 acres of natural firs; and in other parts,
the woods are reckoned by miles, not by acres; there are also
oak woods and extensive tracts of birch. In Aberdeenshire, in
the higher divisions of Mar, there are 100 square miles of wood
and plantations. The pines of Braemar are magnificent in size,
and are of the finest quality. Argyleshire, Dumbartonshire, and
Stirlingshire have many thousands of acres of coppice-wood, and,
with a very few exceptions, the remaining counties have many,
and some very extensive plantations.</p>

<p><i>Ireland</i> has every appearance of having been once covered
with wood, but at the present day, timber is exceedingly scarce
in that country, there being no woods, if we except a portion
along the sea-coast of Wicklow, the borders of the Lake Gilly, in
Sligo, some remains of an ancient forest in Galway, and some
small woods round Lough Lene, in the county of Kerry. The
lakes of Westmeath have also some wooded islands. There are
extensive plantations in Waterford, and a few natural woods, of
small extent, in Cavan and Down; but Fermanagh is the best-wooded
part of Ireland. The want of wood, however, in this
country, as far as it is employed for fuel, is little felt, in consequence
of its extensive bogs, which furnish an almost inexhaustible
quantity of peat.</p>

<p>Upon the whole then, though Great Britain and Ireland do
not now possess any extensive forests, still there is a considerable
quantity of timber, and the extent of new plantations seems to
promise that we shall never be wholly destitute of so essential an
article as wood. According to M'Culloch, there is annually cut
down in Great Britain and Ireland, timber to the amount of
£2,000,000.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>In this country, even in the time of the Saxons, the forests or
tracts, more or less covered with wood, were generally public or
crown lands, in which the king was accustomed to take the diversion
of hunting, and that hunting from which all other persons were
prohibited. This distinctly appears from the laws of king Canute,
enacted in 1016. But the prohibition against hunting in
these, was merely a protection thrown around the property of
the crown of the same kind with that afforded to all other lauded
estates, in regard to which, universally, the law was, that every
proprietor might hunt in his own woods or fields, but that no
other person might do so without his leave. On the establishment,
however, of the Norman government, it has generally been
supposed that the property of all the animals of chase throughout
the kingdom was held to be vested in the crown, and no person,
without the express licence of the crown, was allowed to hunt
even upon his own estate. But this, after all, is rather a conjecture;
and, perhaps, all that we are absolutely entitled to affirm,
from the evidence we possess on the subject, is, that after the
Norman conquest the royal forests were guarded with much
greater strictness than before; that possibly in some cases their
bounds were enlarged; that trespasses upon them were punished
with much greater severity; and, finally, that there was established
a new system of laws and of courts for their administration.</p>

<p>In the language of the law, forests and chases differ from parks
in not being enclosed by walls or palings, but only encompassed
by metes and bounds; and a chase differs from a forest, both in
being of much smaller extent (so that there are some chases
within forests) and in its capability of being held by a subject,
whereas a forest can only be in the hands of the Crown. But
the material distinction is, or rather was, that forests alone were
subject to the forest laws so long as they subsisted. Every
forest, however, was also a chase. A forest is defined by Manwood,
the great authority on the forest laws, as being "a certain
territory or circuit of woody grounds and pastures, known in its
bounds, and privileged, for the peaceable being and abiding of
wild beasts, and fowls of forest, chase, and warren, to be under
the king's protection for his princely delight; replenished with
beasts of venery or chase, and great coverts of vert for succour
of the said beasts; for preservation whereof there are particular
laws, privileges, and officers belonging thereunto." The beasts
of park or chase, according to Coke, are properly the buck, the
doe, the fox, the marten, and the roe; but the term, in a wider
sense, comprehends all the beasts of the forest. Beasts of warren
are such as hares, conies, and roes; fowls of warren, such as the
partridge, quail, rail, pheasant, woodcock, mallard, heron, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The national woodlands of England, for many centuries, consisted
of 49 forests, 13 chases, and 781 parks; some of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
being of great extent, as the New Forest in Hampshire, which
still contains about 66,291 acres, and extends over a district of
20 miles from north-east to south-west, and about 15 miles from
east to west. Recent parliamentary inquiry has so fully established
long-continued mismanagement, embezzlement of timber,
and encroachments upon the national forests and parks, that a
considerable portion of what remains will probably be shortly
sold or leased for general cultivation. The principal remaining
national forests and parks are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Although hyphenation was standardized, some words have both hyphaned and
seperate words (for example, "light-green" and "light green") which were
retained due to usage or being in qouatations. Non-standard formatting of
scientific names was not changed (example, both <i>Abies Larix</i> and
Abies Larix appear). The Linnean system terminology was NOT standardized
with the exception of  Mon&oelig;c. as an abbreviation for the term mon&oelig;cious.</p>

<p>The alphabetical letters for the Index, the quick link section and the
